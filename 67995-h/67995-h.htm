<p class='pindent'>Few men in this country have left names as distinguished
as that of Somers, around whose personal
history there remains so much doubt. Had he not
given up his life in the service of the republic, he
would most probably have now been living, in a
green old age. While many of his friends and shipmates
still survive to bear testimony to his bravery
and his virtues, yet no one seems to possess the precise
information that is necessary to a full and accurate
biographical sketch of more than his public services.
The same mystery that has so long clothed
the incidents of his death, appears to have gathered
about those of his early life, veiling the beginning
and the end equally in a sad and uncertain interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family of Somers emigrated from England to
America in the early part of the eighteenth century,
establishing itself at Great Egg Harbor, Gloucester
county, New Jersey. Here the emigrant became the
proprietor of a considerable landed property, most of
which still remains in the hands of his descendants,
the place bearing the name of Somers’ Point. This
Point forms the southeastern extremity of the county,
being separated from that of Cape May merely by
the Harbor. Gordon, in his gazetteer of New Jersey,
thus describes the spot, viz:—“Somers’ Point, post-office
and port of entry for Great Egg Harbor district,
upon the Great Egg Harbor bay, about 43 miles S. E.
from Woodbury, 88 from Trenton, and, by post-route,
196 from Washington. There is a tavern and
boarding-house here, and several farm-houses. It is
much resorted to for sea bathing in summer, and
gunning in the fall season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is believed that the Christian name of the emigrant
was John, and as this was also the baptismal
designation of the celebrated jurist, who came from
the middle class of society, the circumstances, taken
in connection with the fact that the family was
known to have been respectable in England, leaves
the strong probability that the parties had a common
origin. At all events, this John Somers, by his possessions
and position, must have been of a condition
in life much superior to the great body of the emigrants
to the American colonies. Report makes him
a man of strong English habits and character, while
there is a tradition among his descendants of the
existence of a mother, or of a mother-in-law, who
was of French extraction, and a native of Acadie.
This person may have been the mother of the wife
of the emigrant, however; but the circumstance is
not without interest, when it is remembered that the
regretted Somers himself, like his intimate friend,
Decatur, had more of the physical appearance of one
descended from a French stock, than of one who
was derived from a purely Anglo-Saxon ancestry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The property at Somers’ Point descended principally,
if not entirely, to the two sons of the emigrant,
John and Richard. John, the eldest, lived and died
on the estate, where his descendants are still to be
found. Richard, the youngest, married Sophia Stillwell,
of the same part of his native province, by
whom he had four children, Constant, Sarah, Jane
and Richard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Constant Somers married Miss Leaming, of Cape
May county, and died young, leaving a son and a
daughter. The former, who bore his father’s name,
was accidentally killed at Cronstadt, in Russia, while
yet a youth, and the daughter married a gentleman
of the name of Corsen, also of Cape May county,
and has issue. These children are the only descendants,
in the third generation, of Richard Somers, the
second son of the emigrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah Somers married Captain Keen, of Philadelphia,
and still survives as his widow, but has no
children. Richard, the youngest child, is the subject
of our memoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Somers, the elder, would seem to have
been a man of considerable local note. He was a
colonel of the militia, a judge of the county court,
and his name appears among those of the members
from his native county in the Provincial Congress,
for the year 1775; though it would seem that he did
not take his seat. Col. Somers was an active whig
in the Revolution, and was much employed, in the
field and otherwise; more especially during the first
years of the great struggle for national existence.
His influence, in the part of New Jersey where
he resided, was of sufficient importance to render
him particularly obnoxious to the attacks of
the tories, who were in the practice of seizing prominent
whigs, and of carrying them within the British
lines; and Great Egg Harbor being much exposed to
descents from the side of the sea, Col. Somers was
induced to remove to Philadelphia with his family,
for protection. As this removal must have been
made after the town was evacuated by Sir Henry
Clinton, it could not have taken place earlier than
the autumn of 1778; and there is good reason for
thinking it occurred two or three seasons later.
Here Col. Somers remained for several years, or
nearly down to the period of his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Somers, the son of Richard, and the
grandson of the emigrant, was born September 15th,
1778, and it is known that his birth took place prior
to the removal of his parents to Philadelphia. As
his father was born November 24, 1737, it determines
two facts: first, that the family must have emigrated
at least as early as 1730, if not some years earlier;
and, secondly, that Col. Somers had reached middle
age when his distinguished and youngest child drew
his earliest breath. Somers first went to school in
Philadelphia, and was subsequently sent to Burlington,
where there was then an academy of some merit
for the period. At the latter place the boy continued
until near the time of the death of his father, if not
quite down to the day of that event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Col. Somers died in 1793 or 1794; two records of
his death existing, one of which places it in the former,
and the other in the latter year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is even some uncertainty thrown around
the precise period when Somers first went to sea.
His nearest surviving relative is of opinion that he
had never entered upon the profession when he
joined the navy; but this opinion is met by the more
precise knowledge of one of his shipmates in the
frigate in which he first served, who affirms that the
young man was a very respectable seaman on coming
on board. The result of our inquiries is to convince
us that Somers must have gone to sea somewhere
about the year 1794, or shortly after the death of his
father, and when he himself was probably between
fifteen and sixteen years of age. The latter period,
indeed, agrees with that named by the relative mentioned,
as his age when he went to sea, though it is
irreconcilable with the date of the equipment of the
man-of-war he first joined, and that of his own warrant
in the navy. From the best information in our
possession, therefore, we are led to believe that the
boy sailed, first as a hand and then as a mate, if not
as master, on board a coaster, owned by some one of
his own family, of which more than one plied between
Great Egg Harbor and the ports of New York
and Philadelphia. This accords, too, with his known
love of adventure and native resolution, as well as
with his orphan condition; though he inherited from
his father a respectable property, including a portion
of the original family estate, as well as of lands in
the interior of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his boyhood and youth, Somers was remarkable
for a chivalrous sense of honor, great mildness of
manner and disposition, all mingled with singular
firmness of purpose. His uncle, John Somers, who
was the head of the family, and as such maintained
an authority that was more usual in the last century
than it is to-day, is described as an austere man, who
was held in great awe by his relatives, and who was
accustomed to meet with the greatest deference
amongst his kindred, not only for all his commands,
but for most of his opinions. The firmness and decision
shown by his nephew Richard, however, in a
controversy about a dog, in which the uncle was
wrong and the boy right, are said to have astonished
the whole family, and to have created a profound
respect in the senior for the junior, that continued as
long as the two lived. Richard could not have been
more than twelve when this little incident occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somers received his warrant as a midshipman in
the spring of 1798. This was, virtually, at the commencement
of the present navy, the Ganges 21, Capt.
Dale, the first vessel that got out, being ordered to
sea May 22d of that year. The Ganges was soon
followed by the Constellation 38, and Delaware 20,
the three ships cruising on the coast to prevent the
depredations committed by French privateers. The
next vessel out was the United States 44, bearing the
broad pennant of Com. John Barry, the senior officer
of the service. To this vessel Somers was attached,
making his first cruise in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States was then, as now, one of the
finest frigates that floats. Equipped in Philadelphia,
the capital of the country, and the centre of
American civilization, and commanded by an experienced
and excellent officer, no young man could
have commenced his professional career under more
favorable auspices than was the case with Somers.
The ship had for lieutenants, Ross 1st, Mullowney
2d, Barron 3d, and Stewart 4th. The two latter are
now the senior officers of the service. Among his
messmates in the steerage, Somers had for friends
and associates Decatur and Caldwell, both Philadelphians.
It is a proof that Somers had been previously
to sea, that, on joining this ship, he was named as
master’s mate of the hold, a situation uniformly
given, in that day, to the most experienced and trustworthy
of the midshipmen. It was while thus associated,
that the close connection was generated between
Somers and Decatur, which, for the remainder
of their joint lives, rendered them generous professional
rivals and fast personal friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States sailed on her first cruise early
in July, 1798, going to the eastward, where she collected
a small squadron, that had come out of the
ports of New England, and with which she soon after
proceeded to the West Indies. She remained cruising
in those seas for the remainder of the year, as the
commanding vessel; Com. Barry having collected a
force of some twenty sail under his orders by the
commencement of winter. Shortly after Mr. Ross
left the ship, and Messrs. Mullowney and Barron
were promoted. This occurred in the spring of 1799,
when Mr. Stewart became 1st lieutenant of the
frigate, Mr. Edward Meade 2d, Somers 3d, and Decatur
4th. Thus the service of Somers, as a midshipman,
could not have exceeded a twelvemonth: conclusive
evidence of his having been at sea previously
to joining the navy, were any other testimony required
than that of his shipmates. In the autumn of
1799, the United States sailed from Newport, Rhode
Island, for Lisbon, having on board, as commissioners
to the French republic, the gentlemen who subsequently
arranged the terms of peace. It is probable
that Somers, whose previous experience had been in
the American seas, crossed the Atlantic for the first
time in this cruise. Mr. Stewart being placed in
command of the Experiment 12, in the year 1800,
Somers ended the war as second lieutenant of the
ship he had joined as a midshipman about three years
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war of 1798 allowed but few opportunities for
officers to distinguish themselves. But two frigate
actions were fought, and, singularly enough, on the
side of the Americans, both fell to the share of the
same commander and the same ship, Truxtun and
the Constellation; leaving little but vigilant watchfulness
and activity to the lot of the other officers and
vessels. While the United States had no chance for
earning laurels, she was always a model cruiser for
discipline and seamanship, and the young men who
served in her during the quasi-war, had no grounds
of complaint on the score of either precept or example.
They had been in an excellent school, and
the “Old Wagoner,” as this vessel was afterwards
called, turned out as many distinguished officers as
any vessel of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the formation of the peace establishment, in
1801, Somers was retained as the twelfth lieutenant,
in a list that then presented only thirty-six officers of
that rank. The rapid promotion which marked the
first few years of the existence of the present marine,
belongs to the history of the day, and must be ascribed
to the occurrence of two wars in quick succession,
and to the wants of an infant service. The
list alluded to forms a subject of melancholy and yet
of proud interest to every American who is familiar
with this branch of the republic’s annals. It is headed
by the name of Charles Stewart, and it closes with
that of Jacob Jones. Hull, Shaw, Chauncey and
Smith precede Somers on this list; Decatur stands
next to him; and Dent, Porter, the elder Cassin,
Gordon and Caldwell follow. A long list of names
that have since become distinguished, including
those of M’Donough, Lawrence, the younger Biddle,
Perry, the younger Cassin, Trippe, Allen, Burrows,
Blakely, Downes, Crane, Morris, Ridgely, Warrington,
the elder Wadsworth, &amp;c. &amp;c., was then to be
found among the midshipmen. Not a name below
that of the seventeenth captain of the present day
(Woodhouse,) was on the navy register of that
period at all; that of Sloat, now the thirty-third
captain, having lost its place in consequence of a
resignation. When Commodores Stewart and Hull
examine the present register, they find on it but
eleven names, besides their own, that were there
even when they were made commanders. They both
remain captains themselves to this hour!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States was laid up in ordinary at the
peace of 1801, and there was this noble frigate suffered
to remain, until she was again commissioned
for the coast service, a few months previously to the
war of 1812. Among the vessels that were built to
meet the emergency of the French struggle, was a
frigate called the Boston, a vessel that it was usual
then to rate as a thirty-two, but which was properly
a twenty-eight, carrying only twenty-four twelves on
her gun deck. This little ship had fought a spirited
action with a heavy French corvette called the
Berceau, in the war that had just terminated, and
had brought in her antagonist. This circumstance
rendered her a favorite, and she was kept in commission
at the termination of hostilities, under the command
of Captain Daniel M’Niell, an officer of whose
eccentricities there will be occasion to speak, when
we come to the record of his extraordinary career.
Somers, on quitting the United States, was transferred
to the Boston as her first lieutenant. The ship
sailed from New York in the summer of 1801, for
L’Orient, in France, having on board Chancellor
Livingston and suite, the newly appointed legation
to that country. After landing the minister, the Boston
proceeded to the Mediterranean. The cruise of
this ship was remarkable for its entire independence.
Capt. M’Niell had been ordered to join the Mediterranean
squadron, then under the pennant of Com.
Dale; and, although he was in that sea during parts
of the commands of that officer and his successor,
Com. Morris, he so successfully eluded both as never
to fall in with them; or, if he met the latter at all, it
was only for a moment, and near the end of his
own cruise. Capt. M’Niell, notwithstanding, wanted
for neither courage nor activity. He visited many
ports, gave frequent convoys, and even went off
Tripoli, the scene of the war; but, from accident or
design, all this was so timed as to destroy every
thing like concert and combination. In this cruise
Somers had an opportunity of seeing many of the
ports of Italy, Spain, and the islands, and doubtless
he acquired much of that self-reliance and experience
which are so necessary to a seaman, in his responsible
station of a first lieutenant. He was then a
very young man, not more than twenty-four; and
this was a period of life when such opportunities
were of importance. Nor does he seem to have neglected
them, as all of his cotemporaries speak of his
steadiness of character, good sense, and amiable,
correct deportment, with affection and respect. The
Boston returned home at the close of 1802, when
Capt. M’Niell retired from the service, under the
reduction law, and the ship was laid up, never to be
employed again. The commander subsequently
returned to the seas, in the revenue service, but the
frigate lay rotting at Washington, until she was burned
at the inroad of the enemy, in 1814, a worthless hulk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the reduction of the navy in 1801, but one vessel
below the rate of a frigate, the Enterprise 12,
was retained in the marine. Most of the sloops that
had been used in the French war were clumsy vessels
with gun-decks, that had been bought into the
service. They were not fit to be preserved, and the
department was not sorry to get rid of them. By
this time, however, the want of small vessels was
much felt in carrying on the Tripolitan war, and a
law providing for the construction of four vessels of
not more than sixteen guns, passed in the session of
1802-3. These vessels were the Siren 16, Argus 16,
Nautilus 12, and Vixen 12. As the country at that
day had no proper yards, it was customary to assign
certain officers to superintend the building and equipment
of vessels on the stocks, the selections being
commonly made from those who it was intended
should subsequently serve in them. On this occasion
Decatur was attached to the Argus, it being
understood he was to take her to the Mediterranean
and give her up to Hull, receiving the Enterprise
from the latter in exchange, as the junior officer.
Stewart was given the Siren, as his due; Smith got
the Vixen; and Somers the Nautilus. By this time,
or in the spring of 1803, owing to resignations, the
latter stood seventh on the list of lieutenants, Smith
being one before him, and Decatur one his junior.
Stewart and Hull headed the register. Of the thirty-six
officers of this rank retained under the reduction
law, but twenty-five then remained in service. To-day
their number is lowered to three, viz: Stewart,
Hull and Jacob Jones!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nautilus, the first and only command of
Somers, was a beautiful schooner of about 160 or
170 tons, and mounted twelve 18 lb. carronades, with
two sixes, having a crew of from 75 to 95 souls.
This was a handsome situation for a young sailor of
twenty-four, who had then followed his profession
but about nine years, and who had been in the navy
but five, having commenced a midshipman. In that
day, however, no one envied Somers, or believed
him unduly favored, for he was thought to be an old
officer, though he had not been half the time in service
which is now employed in the subordinate situations
of midshipman and passed midshipman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mediterranean squadron, which sailed in the
summer and autumn of 1803, was that which subsequently
became so celebrated under the orders of
Preble. It consisted of the Constitution 44, Preble’s
own ship; the Philadelphia 38, Capt. Bainbridge;
Argus 16, first, Lieut. Com. Decatur, then, Lieut. Com.
Hull; Siren 16, Lieut. Com. Stewart; Vixen 12,
Lieut. Com. Smith; Enterprise 12, first, Lieut. Com.
Hull, then, Lieut. Com. Decatur; and Nautilus 12,
Lieut. Com. Somers. These vessels did not proceed
to their station in squadron, but they left home as
they got ready. The Enterprise was already out,
but, of the ships fitting, the Nautilus was the first
equipped, and the first to sail. Somers left America
early in the summer, and anchored in Gibraltar Bay
on the 27th July. The remaining vessels arrived at
different times, between the last of August and the
first of November. After a short stop at Gibraltar,
the Nautilus went aloft, giving convoy when required,
returning to the Rock in time to meet the
commodore in September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relief and the homeward bound squadrons, or
at least that part of the former which had then arrived
and was below, and the return ships under Com.
Rodgers, met at Gibraltar early in September. The
state of the relations with Morocco being very precarious,
Com. Preble determined to make an effort
to avert a new war, and Com. Rodgers handsomely
consenting to aid him, the former proceeded to Tangiers
with all the force he could assemble. Here he
succeeded in awing the Emperor into a treaty, and
in putting a stop to a system of depredations which
the subjects of that prince had already commenced.
The Nautilus formed a part of the force employed on
this occasion, and was particularly useful on account
of her light draught of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After arranging the difficulty with Morocco, Preble
made a formal declaration of the blockade of Tripoli,
before which town he believed that the Philadelphia
and Vixen were then cruising; though, unknown to
him, the latter had been temporarily detached, and
the Philadelphia was in possession of the enemy.
From this time until the succeeding spring, the Nautilus
was employed in convoying, or in carrying
orders necessary to the preparations that were making
for the coming season; but in March she formed a
part of the blockading force in front of Tripoli. In
consequence of the captivity of Capt. Bainbridge,
Lieut. Com. Stewart was the officer second in rank
in the squadron, and he was consequently kept much
upon the coast in command, while Preble was carrying
on the negotiations by means of which he obtained
the gunboats and other supplies necessary to
the attacks he contemplated. In March, 1804, while
the Siren and Nautilus were alone maintaining the
blockade, the two vessels had been driven to the
eastward of their port by a gale, and early in the
morning, while returning, they made a warlike looking
brig lying to off the place, with which she was
evidently in communication. Signal was made to
the Nautilus to stand close in, and watch the gunboats,
while the Siren ran alongside of the stranger,
who was captured for a violation of the blockade.
The prize proved to be a privateer called the Transfer,
with an English commission. She carried 16
guns and 80 men, and hailed from Malta, but, in fact,
belonged to the Bashaw of Tripoli; her papers
having been obtained through the Tripolitan consul
in Malta, who was a native of that island. This
vessel was appraised, equipped by the squadron, and
used in the war, having had her name changed to the
Scourge. Owing to certain scruples of Mr. Jefferson
on the subject of blockades, the vessel was not condemned
until the war of 1812, nor were the captors
paid their prize money until Somers had been dead
nearly eleven years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the time of the capture of the Transfer
and the month of July, the Nautilus was much employed
by the commodore, going below and visiting
different ports in Sicily. On the 20th of that month,
Somers sailed from Malta, in company with the Constitution,
the Enterprise, two bomb ketches and six
gunboats that had been obtained from the Neapolitans,
bound off Tripoli. On the arrival of the commodore,
his whole force was collected, and that
series of short but brilliant operations commenced,
which has rendered the service of this season so
remarkable in the history of the American navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A spirit of high emulation existed among the young
commanders by whom Preble now found himself
supported. Hull was the oldest in years, and he had
hardly reached the prime of life; while Stewart,
Smith, Somers and Decatur were all under six-and-twenty.
With the exception of the commodore, no
commanding officer was married, and most of them
were bound together by the ties of intimate friendships.
In a word, their lives, as yet, had been prosperous;
the past left little to complain of, the future
was full of hope; and there had been little opportunity
for that spirit of selfishness which is so apt to
generate quarrels, to get possession of minds so free
and temperaments so ardent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the proper place to allude to a private adventure
of Somers’, about the existence of which
there would seem to be no doubt, though like so
much that belonged to this interesting man its details
are involved in obscurity. While at Syracuse, where
the American vessels made their principal rendezvous,
he was walking in the vicinity of the town
in company with two brother officers, when five
men carrying swords, who were afterwards ascertained
to be soldiers of the garrison, made an attack
on the party, with an intent to rob. One of the gentlemen
was provided with a dirk, but Somers and
the other were totally unarmed. The officer with the
dirk used the weapon so vigorously as soon to bring
down one assailant, while Somers grappled with
another. In the struggle Somers seized the blade of
his antagonist’s sword, and was severely cut in the
hand by the efforts of the robber to recover it, but the
latter did not succeed, the weapon being wrested
from him and plunged into his own body. This decided
the matter, the three remaining robbers taking
to flight. The dead bodies were carried into the
town and recognized. This adventure is believed to
have occurred while the Nautilus was absent on her
last visit to Sicily, though it may have been of older
date; possibly as old as the time when Somers was
in the Boston. We think the latter improbable, however,
as the circumstance seems to be unknown to
his nearest relatives in this country, which would
hardly have been the case had it taken place previously
to his last visit to America. Our information
comes from an intimate friend, who received the
facts from Somers himself, but who was not at Syracuse
at the moment the attempt to rob occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gale of wind prevented the American vessels
from commencing operations before the 3d of August.
On that day Com. Preble stood in within a league of
Tripoli, with a pleasant breeze from the eastward.
Here he wore ship, with his head off the land, and
signaled all the vessels to pass within hail of the
Constitution. As the brigs and schooners passed
the frigate each commander was ordered to prepare
for an attack. Every thing was previously arranged,
and the ardor of the young men under the orders of
Preble being of the highest character, in one hour
every man and craft were ready for the contemplated
service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The harbor of Tripoli lies in a shallow indentation
of the coast, being tolerably protected against easterly
and westerly gales by the formation of the land,
while a reef of rocks, which stretches for a mile and
a half in a northeasterly course, commencing at the
town itself, breaks the seas that roll in from the northward.
This reef extends near half a mile from the
walls, entirely above water, and is of sufficient
height and width to receive water batteries, containing
the Lazaretto and one or two forts. It is this
commencement of the reef which constitutes what is
usually termed the mole, and behind it lies the harbor
proper. At its termination is a narrow opening in
the reef which is called the western entrance, through
which it is possible for a ship to pass, though the
channel is not more than two hundred feet in width.
Beyond this passage the rocks reappear, with intervals
between them, though lying on shoals with from
one and a half to five and a half feet of water.
The line of rocks and shoals extends more than a
mile outside of the western entrance. Beyond its
termination is the principal entrance to Tripoli,
which is of sufficient width though not altogether free
from shoals. The distance across the bay, from the
northeastern extremity of the rocks to what is called
the English fort, on the main land, is about two
thousand yards, or quite within the effective range of
heavy guns. In the bottom of the bay, or at the
southeastern angle of the town, stands the bashaw’s
castle, a work of some size and force. It lies rather
more than half a mile from the western entrance,
and somewhat more than a mile from the outer extremity
of the reef. Thus any thing within the rocks
is commanded by all the water defences of the place,
while shot from the castle, and more especially from
the natural mole, would reach a considerable distance
into the offing. Some artificial works aided in
rendering the northwestern corner of the harbor still
more secure, and this place is usually called the galley
mole. Near this is the ordinary landing, and it
is the spot that may properly be termed the port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tripolitans fully expected the attack of the
2d of August, though they little anticipated its desperate
character, or its results. They had anchored
nine of their large, well-manned gunboats just outside
of what are called the Harbor Rocks, or the
northeastern extremity of the reef, evidently with a
view of flanking the expected attack on the town,
which, lying on the margin of the sea, is much exposed,
though the rocks in its front were well garnished
with heavy guns. Accustomed to cannonading
at the distance of a mile, these gunboats expected
no warmer service, more especially as a
nearer approach would bring their assailants within
reach of the castle and batteries. In addition to the
nine boats to the eastward, there were five others
which also lay along the line of rocks nearer to the
western entrance, and within pistol shot of the batteries
in that part of the defences. Within the reef
were five more gunboats and several heavy galleys,
ready to protect the outer line of gunboats at need,
forming a reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Com. Preble had borrowed only six gunboats from
the King of Naples, and these were craft that were
much inferior in size and force to the generality of
those used by the enemy. Each of these boats had
a few Neapolitans in her to manage her on ordinary
occasions, but, for the purposes of action, officers and
crews were detailed from the different vessels of the
squadron. These six boats were divided into two
divisions; to the command of one was assigned
Lieut. Com. Somers, while Lieut. Com. Decatur led
the other. Somers was thought to be the senior lieutenant
of the two, though Decatur was at this time
actually a captain, and Somers himself was a master
commandant; as well as Stewart, Hull and Smith,
though the intelligence of these promotions had not
yet reached the squadron. The three boats commanded
by Somers were</p>

<p class='noindent'>Somers had with him in No. 1 a crew from his own
schooner, and Messrs. Ridgely and Miller, midshipmen;
the former being the present Com. Ridgely.
Decatur had the late Lieut. Jonathan Thorn, who
was subsequently blown up on the Northwest Coast
of America, and the modest, but lion-hearted,
M’Donough. Trippe had with him in No. 6 the late
Com. J. D. Henley and the late Capt. Deacon, both
then midshipmen. Of all these gallant young men
Ridgely alone survives!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the intention of Preble to attack the eastern
division of the enemy’s boats with his own flotilla,
while the ketches bombarded the town, and the
frigate and sloop covered both assaults with their
round and grape. With this object in view, the
whole force stood in towards the place at half past
one, the gunboats in tow. Half an hour later the
latter were cast off and formed in advance, while the
brigs and schooners, six in number, formed a line
without them, and the ketches began to throw their
shells. The batteries were instantly in a blaze,
and the Americans immediately opened from all their
shipping in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Circumstances had thrown the division of gunboats
commanded by Somers to leeward of that
commanded by Decatur. It was on the right of the
little line, and, under ordinary occurrences, it would
have been the most exposed, being nearest to the
batteries and the weight of the Tripolitan fire, but
Decatur gave a new character to the whole affair by
his extraordinary decision and intrepidity. The
manner in which this chivalrous officer led on in a
hand-to-hand conflict will be related in his own
biography, but it may be well to state here that he
was sustained only by Trippe, in No. 6, and his
brother James, in No. 2; the latter being far enough
to windward to fetch into the easternmost division of
the Tripolitan boats, though belonging to the division
commanded by Somers. No. 5, Lieut. Bainbridge,
was disabled in approaching, though she continued
to engage, and finally grounded on the rocks. Deprived
of the support of No. 2, by the successful
effort of her gallant commander to close with the
easternmost division, and of that of No. 3, in consequence
of a signal of recall that was made from the
Constitution, which arrested the movements of that
boat though it was either unseen or disregarded by
all the others, Somers found himself alone, within the
line of small vessels, and much exposed to the fire
of the leeward division of the enemy’s boats, as well
as to that of the nearest battery. The struggle to
windward was too fierce to last long, and Preble
fearing that some of the gunboats might be pushed
into extreme peril, made the signal of recall, at least
an hour before the firing ceased, No. 1 with Somers
and his brave companions being all that time in the
very forlorn hope of the affair so far as missiles were
concerned. As soon as it had been ascertained that
he could not fetch into the most weatherly division
of the enemy, Somers had turned like a lion on that
to leeward, and engaged the whole of that division,
five in number and at least of five times his own
force, within pistol shot; one party being sustained
by some of the vessels outside, and the other by the
batteries and the craft within the rocks. In consequence
of the direction of the wind, the only means,
short of anchoring, that could be devised to prevent
No. 1 from drifting directly down, as it might be,
into the enemy’s hands, was to keep the sweeps backing
astern, while the long gun of the boat delivered
bags of musket balls filled with a thousand bullets
each. In the end, the enemy was obliged to make
off, and Somers was extricated from his perilous
position by the approach of the Constitution, which
enabled him to obey the commodore’s signal and
bring out his boat in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the extraordinary nature of the hand-to-hand
conflict in which Decatur had been engaged
threw a sort of shade over the efforts of the other
vessels employed that day, the feeling of admiration
for the conduct of Somers, in particular, was very
general in the squadron. Apart from the struggles
with the pike, sword and bayonet, his position was
much the most critical of any vessel engaged in the
attack, and no man could have behaved better than
he was admitted to have done. In short, next to
Nos. 4 and 6, No. 1, it was conceded, had most
distinguished herself, although No. 2, under James
Decatur, did as well as the circumstances would
allow. One of the best evidences which can be given
of the spirit of this attack is to be found in the trifling
nature of the loss the Americans suffered. But fourteen
men were killed and wounded in all the vessels,
and of these thirteen were on board the gunboats.
No. 1, notwithstanding her great exposure, had only
two casualties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Americans employed themselves, between the
3d and 7th of August, in altering the rigs of the three
boats they had taken in their first assault, and in
equipping them for service. They were all ready
by the morning of the last day, and were taken into
the line as Nos. 7, 8 and 9. At half past 2, the
ketches began again to throw their shells, and the
nine gunboats opened a heavy fire, still in two divisions
commanded as before, though the enemy this
time kept his small vessels too far within the rocks
to be liable to another attempt at boarding. While
No. 1 was advancing to her station, on this occasion,
Somers stood leaning against her flag-staff. In this
position he saw a shot flying directly in a line for
him, and bowed his head to avoid it. The shot cut
the flag-staff, and on measuring afterwards, it was
rendered certain that he escaped death only by the
timely removal. The boats were under fire three
hours in this attack; one of them, commanded by
Lieut. Caldwell, of the Siren, having been blown up.
Between 5 and 6 P. M., the brigs and schooners took
the lighter craft in tow, and carried them beyond the
reach of the batteries. In this affair Somers’ boat
was hulled by a heavy shot, and was much exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange sail hove in sight near the close of this
attack, and she proved to be the John Adams 28,
Capt. Chauncey, last from home. This ship brought
out the commissions already mentioned, as having
been issued some time previously. By this promotion,
Somers became a master commandant, or a
commander, as the grade is now termed; a rank in
the navy which corresponds to that of a major in the
army, and which entitles its possessor to the command
of a sloop of war. Several of these commanders
were made at this time, of whom Somers
ranked as the seventh, which was precisely the number
he had previously occupied on the list of lieutenants.
There was a peculiarity about this promotion
which is worthy of comment, and which goes
to show the irregularities that have been practised in
a service which is generally understood to be governed
and protected by the most precise principles
and enactments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly some, and it is believed that <span class='it'>all</span> the commissions
of commanders, bestowed upon the service
in 1804, were issued without referring the nominations
to the Senate for confirmation. We have examined
one of these commissions, and find that it
contains no allusion to that body, as is always done
in those cases in which a confirmation has been had;
and the omission raises a curious question as to the
legality of the appointments. As the rank of commander
in the navy has never been declared by law
to be one of those offices in which the appointing
power is exclusively bestowed on the president, or a
head of a department, it follows that it comes within
the ordinary provision of the constitution. Now, in
all the latter cases, the power of the executive to
appoint is confined to that of filling vacancies which
occur in the recess of the Senate, and the commission
issued, even under this strictly constitutional
authority, is valid only until the expiration of the
succeeding session of that body. Thus three questions
present themselves as to the legality of these
commissions. First, that the grade of masters and
commanders had been indirectly, if not directly,
abolished by the reduction law of 1801; and, such
being the fact, the constitution giving to Congress
full powers to pass laws for the government of the
army and navy, it may well be questioned if the president
and Senate united had any legal right to reestablish
the grade by the mere use of the appointing
power. Second, whether such a vacancy existed as
to authorize the president to fill it in the recess of the
Senate, had Congress renewed the rank by law,
which, however, is believed not to have been the
fact; and, third, whether the commissions actually
granted, being without the advice and consent of the
Senate, could be legal, after the close of the succeeding
session of that body, under any circumstances.
As to the last objection, it is understood all
the gentlemen who received these commissions continued
to serve under them until they died, resigned,
or were promoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grave considerations connected with courts
martial, commands, and other legal consequences,
which unavoidably offer themselves when we are
made acquainted with so extraordinary a state of
facts, are materially lessened by the circumstances
that all the gentlemen thus irregularly promoted were
officers in the navy under their former commissions,
and that no relative rank was disturbed. Thus if
Messrs. Stewart and Hull were not legally the two
oldest commanders in the service, they were the two
oldest lieutenants, and all the other commanders
being in the same dilemma with themselves, their
relative rank remained precisely as it would have
done had no new commissions been granted. So
also as regards courts; the judge having a right to
sit as a lieutenant, unless, indeed, the informality of
annexing a wrong rank to the orders might raise a
legal objection.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>That so gross an irregularity should have arisen
under a government that professes to be one purely
of law, excites our wonder; and this so much the
more, when we remember it occurred in a service
in which life itself maybe the penalty of error. The
explanation is to be found in the infancy of the
establishments, and in practices in which principles
remained to be settled, aided by the known moral
courage and exceeding personal popularity of the
statesman who then presided in the councils of the
republic. While Jefferson affected, and probably
felt, a profound respect for legality, he is known to
have used the power he wielded with great political
fearlessness, and to have considered himself as the
head of a new school in the administration of the
government, which did not always hesitate about the
introduction of new rules of conduct. To these remarks,
however, it must in justice be added, that no
party or personal views could have influenced the
appointments in question, which, apart from the irregularity
of their manner, were certainly required
equally by justice and the wants of the service, and
which were made in perfect conformity with the
rules of promotion as observed under the severest
principles of military preferment. They prove even
more in favor of the statesman, as they show that he
did not deserve all the accusations of hostility to this
branch of the national defences that were heaped
upon him; but rather that he was disposed to stretch
his authority to foster and advance it. The introduction
of a new class of vessels, too, required the revival
of a class of officers of a rank proper to command
them; and, though we wish never to see illegality
countenanced in the management of interests
as delicate as those of a marine, it is desirable to see
the proper authorities of the country imitate this
feature of the case, now that the republic has fleets
which flag officers alone can ever lead with a proper
degree of dignity and authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the 28th of August before another attack
was made on Tripoli, in which Somers participated.
The ketches bombarded it on the night of the 24th;
but finding little impression made by this mode of
assault, Com. Preble determined to renew the cannonading.
On this occasion Capt. Somers led one
division of the gunboats, as before, while Capt. Decatur
led the other; the latter having five of these
craft under his orders, and the former three. The
approach was made under the cover of darkness, all
the boats anchoring near the rocks, where they
opened a heavy fire on the shipping, castle and town.
The brigs and schooners assisted in this attack, and
at daylight the frigate stood in, and opened her batteries.
The Tripolitan galleys and gunboats, thirteen
in all, were principally opposed to the eight American
gunboats, which did not retire until they had
expended their ammunition. One Tripolitan was
sunk, two more were run on shore, and all were
finally driven into the mole by the frigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 3d of September, a fourth and last attack
was made on Tripoli by the gunboats, aided by all
the other vessels. The Turkish boats did not wait,
as before, to be assaulted off the town, but, accompanied
by the galleys, they placed themselves under
Fort English, and a new battery that had been built
near it, with an intention to draw the American shot
in that direction. This change of disposition induced
Preble to send Captains Decatur and Somers, with
the gunboats, covered by the brigs and schooners,
into the harbor’s mouth, while the ketches bombarded
more to leeward. On this occasion, Somers
was more than an hour hotly engaged, pressing the
enemy into his own port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The season was now drawing near a close, and
the arrival of reinforcements from America had been
expected, in vain, for several weeks. It was during
this interval that a plan for destroying the enemy’s
flotilla, as it lay anchored in his innermost harbor,
was conceived, and preparations were soon made
for putting it in execution. The conception of this
daring scheme has been claimed for Somers himself,
and not without a share of reason. There existed
between him and Decatur a singular professional
competition, that was never permitted, however, to
cool their personal friendship. The great success
of the latter, in his daring assaults, stimulated Somers
to attempt some exploit equally adventurous, and
none better than the one adopted then offered. The
five attacks made on Tripoli, with the vigorous
blockade, had produced a sensible effect on the tone
of the bashaw, and it was hoped that a blow as appalling
as that now meditated, might at once produce
a peace. The delicacy that a commander would
naturally feel about proposing a service so desperate
to a subordinate, renders it highly probable that the
idea originated with Somers himself, who thus secured
the office of endeavoring to execute it. It is
proper to add, however, that Com. Preble says the
project had long been in contemplation, though he
does not say who suggested it. The plan was as
follows: The ketch that had originally been taken
by Decatur in the Enterprise, and in which he had
subsequently carried the Philadelphia frigate, was
still in the squadron. She had been named the Intrepid,
for the brilliant occasion on which she had
first been used, but had since fallen from her high
estate, having latterly been employed in bringing
water and stores from Malta. This craft had been
constructed for a gun vessel by the French, in their
expedition against Egypt; from their service she
had passed into that of Tripoli; had fallen into the
hands of warriors from the new world; by them she
had been used in one of the most brilliant exploits of
naval warfare, and was now about to terminate her
career in another, of the most desperate and daring
character. It was proposed to fit up the ketch in the
double capacity of fire-ship and infernal, and to send
her into the inner harbor of Tripoli, by the western
passage, there to explode in the very centre of the
vessels of the Turks. As her deck was to be covered
with missiles, and a large quantity of powder was to
be used, it was hoped that the town and castle would
suffer, not less than the shipping. The panic created
by such an assault, made in the dead of night, it was
fondly hoped would produce an instant peace, and,
more especially, the liberation of the crew of the
Philadelphia. The latter object was deemed one of
high interest to the whole force before Tripoli, and
was never lost sight of in all their operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Com. Preble having determined upon his plan,
Somers received the orders to commence the preparations;
a duty in which he had the advice and
assistance of Decatur, Stewart, and the other commanders
of the squadron; for all these ardent and
gallant young men felt a common sympathy in his
daring, and an equal interest in his anticipated
triumph. The first step was to prepare the ketch
for the desperate service in which she was to be engaged.
With this object a small apartment was
planked up in the broadest part of her hold, or just
forward of the principal mast; this was rendered as
secure as was believed necessary against accidents.
Into this room a hundred barrels of gunpowder were
emptied in bulk. A train was led aft to a cabin window,
through a tube, and, by some accounts, another
was led into the fore-peak. A port-fire, graduated
to burn a certain number of minutes, was affixed at
the end of the train, and a body of light, splintered
wood was collected in another receptacle abaft the
magazine, which was to be set on fire, with the
double purpose of making certain of the explosion,
and of keeping the enemy aloof under the apprehension
of its flames. On the deck of the ketch, around
the mast and immediately over the magazine, were
piled a quantity of shells of different sizes with their
fuses prepared, in the expectation that the latter
would ignite and produce the usual explosion. The
number of these shells has been variously stated at
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty,
the size ranging from nine to thirteen and a half
inches. The best information, however, would
seem to place the number below two hundred. Some
accounts give the quantity of powder as high us
fifteen thousand pounds, which was probably near
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two boats were to accompany the ketch, one an
exceedingly fast rowing four-oared boat, being lent
for the purpose by the Siren, and the other a
six-oared cutter of the Constitution. The service
requiring but few men, no more were employed than
were necessary to pull the two boats. To have gone
in with a single boat would have been unnecessarily
hazardous, as a shot might have disabled her, while
the chances of escape were nearly doubled by adding
a second, at the same time that the additional
men did not more than make an ordinary crew for a
Mediterranean craft of the size of the Intrepid. A
second officer, however, was thought necessary, and
Lieut. Henry Wadsworth, of the Constitution, volunteering,
his offer was accepted. Mr. Joseph Israel,
of the same ship, who had just been promoted, was
also anxious to be of the party, but Com. Preble
deeming his assistance unnecessary, permission to
go was refused him. Thus it was intended that the
adventurers should be limited to twelve, of whom
ten were common seamen, one a lieutenant, and the
other a commander; or Somers himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It now became necessary to obtain volunteers for
the Siren’s boat, and a call for this purpose was
made by Somers on the crew of his own vessel, the
Nautilus. Notwithstanding the desperate character
of the service, when the want was stated to the
people of this little vessel every man in her offered
himself to go. This compelled their superior to
make a selection. The other six seamen were obtained
from the Constitution, and were chosen, it is
believed, by Mr. Wadsworth, under the supervision
of the ship’s first lieutenant, who at that time was
the late Capt. Gordon. The four men belonging to
the Nautilus were James Simms, Thomas Tompline,
James Harris and William Keith; all seamen rated.
Mr. Wadsworth took with him from the Constitution
William Harrison, Robert Clark, Hugh M’Cormick,
Jacob Williams, Peter Penner and Isaac W. Downes,
all seamen rated also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several days were necessary to complete all these
arrangements, more especially to equip the ketch in
the manner described, and the action of the 3d had
taken place even after the Intrepid was ready. Somers
made one or two attempts to go in before the
night finally selected, but they were abandoned on
account of the lightness of the air. At length there
were appearances in and about the harbor that induced
him to think that the movements of the fire-vessel
were distrusted, and, fearful of detection, he
decided to go in on the night of the 4th September,
if the thing were at all practicable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several interviews had taken place between Preble
and Somers in the course of the preparations for the
attempt. On one occasion the commodore burnt a
port-fire in order to ascertain its time, and when it
was consumed he asked Somers if he thought the
boats could get out of reach of the shells within the
few minutes it was burning. “I think we can, sir,”
answered Somers. Preble looked intently at the
young man a moment and then inquired if he should
have the time reduced, or the port-fire made shorter.
“I ask for no port-fire at all, sir,” was the reply,
firmly but quietly expressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this interview, Somers expressed his determination
not to allow himself to be captured. The
commodore had felt it to be his duty to point out the
great importance of not letting so large an amount
of powder fall into the enemy’s hands, the Tripolitans
being thought to be short of ammunition, and
all the circumstances united had a tendency to increase
the feeling of stern determination in the minds
of the two officers who were to go in. Both were
singularly quiet men in their ordinary habits, perfectly
free from any thing like noisy declarations or
empty boastings of what they intended to perform,
and this simple announcement of their intentions
not to be taken, appears to have made a deep and
general impression among their brethren in arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of the 4th September, Somers
prepared to take his final departure from the Nautilus,
with a full determination to carry the ketch into
Tripoli that night. Previously to quitting his own
vessel, however, he fell that it would be proper to
point out the desperate nature of the enterprise to the
four men he had selected, that their services might
be perfectly free and voluntary. He told them he
wished no man to accompany him who would not
prefer being blown up to being taken; that such was
his own determination, and that he wished all who
went with him to be of the same way of thinking.
The boat’s crew gave three cheers in answer, and
each man is said to have separately asked to be
selected to apply the match. Once assured of the
temper of his companions, Somers took leave of his
officers, the boat’s crew doing the same, shaking
hands and expressing their feelings as if they felt
assured of their fates in advance. This was done in
good faith, and yet cheerfully; and, of all the desperate
service undertaken by that devoted squadron,
none was ever entered on with so many forebodings
of the fatal consequences to those concerned in it.
Each of the four men made his will verbally; disposing
of his effects among his shipmates like those
who are about to die with disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would seem that the Constitution’s boat did not
join the ketch until it was dusk. When the two
crews were mustered, it was found that Mr. Israel
had managed to get out of the frigate and to join the
party; whether by collusion, or not, it is now impossible
to say. Finding him on board, and admiring
his determination to make one of the party,
Somers consented to his remaining. One account
says he was sent by Preble with a final order, but it
is hardly probable Somers would have allowed him
to remain under such circumstances. He was more
likely to be smuggled in by means of the cutter, and
to be kept when there was no boat by which he
could be sent back. The night of the 4th was not
particularly dark, though it could scarcely be accounted
clear. The stars were visible, but there
was a haze on the water that rendered objects more
uncertain than they would otherwise have been. In
this respect the light was favorable enough, as the
rocks could be seen, while the real character of the
ketch would not be so likely to be discovered from
the shore. The wind was light, from the eastward,
but fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of Somers’ friends visited him on board
the Intrepid before she got under way. Among them
were Stewart and Decatur, with whom he had commenced
his naval career in the United States. These
three young men, then about twenty-six each, were
Philadelphia-bred sailors, and had been intimately
associated in service for the last six years. They all
knew that the enterprise was one of extreme hazard,
and the two who were to remain behind felt a deep
interest in the fate of him who was to go in. Somers
was grave, and entirely without any affectation of
levity or indifference, but he maintained his usual
tranquil and quiet manner. After some conversation,
he took a ring from his finger and breaking it into
three pieces gave each of his companions one, while
he retained the third himself. As the night shut in,
three gunboats were seen at anchor a short distance
within the western entrance, by which the Intrepid
was to pass, and Decatur, who felt a strong anxiety
for the success of his friend, admonished Somers to
take care they did not board him, as it was the intention
to carry the ketch some distance within them.
To this Somers quietly replied that the Turks had
got to be so shy he thought they would be more
likely to cut and run on his approach, than to advance
and meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was eight o’clock in the evening before the Intrepid
lifted her anchor; the Argus, Vixen and Nautilus
weighing and standing in, in company. The
night was sufficiently advanced to cover this movement,
and all four vessels stood down towards
the rocks under their canvass. The last person who
left the ketch was Lieut. Washington Reed, then first
of the Nautilus. This officer did not quit his commander
until it was thought necessary for him to rejoin
the vessel of which he was now in charge.
When he went over the side of the Intrepid, all communication
between the gallant spirits she contained
and the rest of the world ceased. At that time every
thing seemed propitious; Somers was cheerful,
though calm; and perfect order and method prevailed
in the little craft. The leave-taking was affectionate
and serious with the officers, though the common
men appeared to be in high spirits. This was
about nine o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Argus and Vixen lay off at a little distance
from the rocks to attack the galleys or gunboats,
should either attempt to follow the party out on their
retreat, while the Nautilus shortened sail and accompanied
the ketch as close in as was deemed prudent,
with the especial intention of bringing off the boats.
Lieut. Reed directed the present Com. Ridgely, then
one of the Nautilus’ midshipmen,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> to watch the
ketch’s movements with a night-glass; and, as this
order was strictly complied with, it is almost certain
that this officer was the last person of the American
squadron who saw the vessel. It was thought she
was advancing slowly to the last moment, though the
distance and the obscurity render this fact a little
doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preble had directed the Siren to weigh and stand
in, shortly after the other vessels left him, and in
obeying the orders he received Capt. Stewart kept
more in the offing than the vessels which preceded
him. As the direction of the western entrance and
the inner harbor were known, every eye in this brig
was riveted on that quarter in silent suspense. It was
not long before the enemy began to fire at the ketch,
which, by this time, was quite near the batteries,
though the reports were neither rapid nor numerous.
At this moment, near ten o’clock, Capt. Stewart and
Lieut. Carrol were standing in the Siren’s gangway
looking intently towards the place where the ketch
was known to be, when the latter exclaimed, “Look!
see the light!” At that instant a light was seen passing
and waving, as if a lantern were carried by some
person in quick motion along a vessel’s deck. Then
it sunk from view. Half a minute may have elapsed
when the whole firmament was lighted with a fiery
glow, a burning mast, with its sails, was seen in the
air, the whole harbor was momentarily illuminated,
the awful explosion came, and a darkness like that
of doom succeeded. The whole was over in less
than a minute; the flame, the quaking of towers, the
reeling of ships, and even the bursting of shells, of
which most fell in the water, though some lodged
on the rocks. The firing ceased, and from that instant
Tripoli passed the night in a stillness as profound
as that in which the victims of this frightful
explosion have lain from that fatal hour to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nautilus showed lights in hopes to guide the
retreating boats to her side; all eyes in the squadron
looked in vain for the expected signal; a moaning
gun occasionally was heard from the frigate, a fitting
knell for such a disaster; but in vain. No one ever
came back from the ill-fated Intrepid to relate the
history of her loss. The Argus, Vixen and Nautilus
hovered near the rocks until the sun arose, but nothing
was discovered to throw any light on the manner
in which the ketch was lost. The gun-boats
anchored near the pass had been moved; one, it was
thought, had entirely disappeared, and two or three
more were hauled ashore as if shattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the American squadron the opinion was general
that Somers and his determined companions had
blown themselves up to prevent capture. In the absence
of certainty, facts were imagined to render
such a desperate step probable if not necessary. It
was supposed that gunboats had advanced to board
the ketch, and that Somers had fired the train in preference
to falling into the hands of the Tripolitans,
or allowing them to get possession of the powder.
Such appears to have been the opinion of Com. Preble,
who reported as much to the government; and
the country, receiving its impressions from this
source, has long entertained the same idea. A few,
however, of the more thoughtful have always
doubted, and subsequent discoveries have rendered
these doubts more and more probable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the American prisoners in Tripoli was a
surgeon’s mate of the name of Cowdery, now the
oldest surgeon in the navy, who was permitted to go
very much at large in the town, his professional services
being found useful. From this gentleman, from
Capt. Bainbridge’s private journal, and from other
sources equally credible, the following interesting
facts have been obtained, leaving no question of their
accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, neither the works, the town, nor
the Tripolitans themselves, appear to have suffered
any injury by the explosion. Captain Bainbridge, in
his journal, where he speaks of this explosion, says:—“which
unfortunate scheme did no damage whatever
to the Tripolitans; nor did it appear even to
heave them into confusion.” The bashaw, being
desirous of ascertaining how many Americans had
been lost in the explosion, offered a dollar for each
body that could be discovered. This produced the
desired effect, and by the 6th, the dead were all
brought up. The bottom of the ketch had drifted
among the rocks, on the north side of the round battery,
which is near the western entrance, and there
it grounded. In the wreck, two bodies were found.
The Constitution’s cutter, or the six-oared boat, had
drifted on the beach, a short distance to the westward
of the town. One body was in it. Six more bodies
were found on the shore to the southward, and the
remaining four were discovered floating in the harbor.
This makes the entire number of the thirteen
who were lost in the ketch. Captain Bainbridge
describes the six dead whom he saw as “being so
much disfigured, it was impossible to recognize any
known feature to us, or even to distinguish an officer
from a seaman.” Those six bodies were the two
found in the wreck, and the four floating in the harbor.
But Mr. Cowdery was more successful. He
selected three of the bodies as those of officers, being
guided by some fragments of dress still remaining on
them, and still more by the delicate appearance of
their hands. As this was just the number of the
officers who were actually lost, and the Americans in
Tripoli were then entirely ignorant of the character
of the party sent in, it leaves scarcely a doubt that
this gentleman decided accurately. Indeed, if the
palms of the hands were not much injured, it would
not be easy to make a mistake in such a matter; and
any portions of the dress would be almost as safe
guides. The ten seamen were buried on the beach,
outside the town and near the walls; while the three
officers were interred in the same grave, on the plain
beyond, or a cable’s length to the southward and eastward
of the castle. Small stones were placed at the
four corners of this last grave, to mark its site; but
they were shortly after removed by the Turks, who
refused to let what they conceived to be a Christian
monument, disfigure their land. Here, then, lie the
remains of Somers, and his two gallant friends; and
it might be well to instruct the commander of some
national cruiser to search for their bones, that they
might be finally incorporated with the dust of their
native land. Their identity would at once be established
by the number of the skeletons, and the friends
of the deceased might find a melancholy consolation
in being permitted to drop a tear over the spot in
in which they would be finally entombed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts related leave little doubt that Com. Preble
was mistaken in, at least, a portion of his conjectures.
That no Turks suffered, is shown by the direct
testimony of Captain Bainbridge’s journal, a record
made at the time, and that, too, under circumstances
which will not well admit of mistakes. This truth is
also corroborated by other convincing testimony.
Those who saw the explosion, saw no signs of any
vessel near the ketch at the time it occurred, nor
were the vestiges of any wreck, but that of the Intrepid,
to be seen in the harbor. The officer who saw
the ketch to the last moment, by means of the glass, is
not understood to have seen any thing near her, and
the thirteen bodies found, the precise number of the
Americans known to have been lost, go to confirm
the fact. It adds value to the testimony, too, that a
written memorial of this very number of the dead
was made, before the prisoners in Tripoli had any
information concerning the force of the party sent
in from the squadron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is there sufficient reason for supposing that the
Americans blew themselves up, on this occasion.
That Somers went in with a full determination to put
in force this desperate expedient in the event of its
becoming necessary to prevent capture, is beyond
dispute; but there is no proof of the existence of the
necessity. To suppose the <span class='it'>match</span> would have been
applied, except in the last emergency, is to accuse
him who did it, with a want of coolness; a virtue
that Captain Somers possessed in an eminent degree;
and this emergency could hardly have existed without
some of the enemy having been near enough to
suffer by the explosion. The whole party was accustomed
to fire, and it is scarcely possible that they
could have been driven to this desperate step, by
means of injury received in this manner, as they
always had their boats for a flight, when required.
There was a vague rumor that most of the bodies
found had been perforated by grape-shot, and a conjecture
was made that the survivors fired the train,
in order to prevent the Turks from getting possession
of the powder. But the report can be traced to no
sufficient authority, and it is not probable that so
many would have suffered in this way as to prevent
the unhurt from using the boats and the train in the
mode originally contemplated. But one man was
found in the Constitution’s cutter, and he, doubtless,
was the boat-sitter, who lost his life at his post. This
indicates any thing but hurry or alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is also certain that the splinter-room was not
lighted, as its flame would have been both quick and
bright; and, with a thousand anxious eyes on watch,
it could not fail to have been seen. This circumstance
goes further to show, that no gunboat or
galley could have been approaching the ketch at the
time she exploded, one of the purposes of these
splinters being to keep the enemy aloof, through the
dread of a fire-vessel. To suppose a neglect of using
the splinter-room, in a case of necessity, would be
to accuse the party of the same want of coolness as
is inferred by the supposition of their blowing themselves
up when no foe was near. Both were morally
impossible, with such a man as Somers. Admitting
that no Tripolitan vessel was near the Intrepid, and
still insisting that the train was fired by the Americans,
no reason can be given why the preparations
for the safety of the latter’s crew, should not have
been used. The Constitution’s cutter was found with
its keeper alone in it, but of the Siren’s boat we have
no account. The latter was probably alongside the
ketch and destroyed; it may have been sunk by a
falling shell; or it may have been privately appropriated
to himself by some Turk. That no one was
in it, however, is shown by the twelve bodies that
were found out of the boats; for, if manned, and a
few yards from the ketch, the crew would have been
blown into its bottom, and not into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abandoning the idea that the Intrepid was intentionally
blown up, by Somers and his party, we have
the alternatives of believing the disaster to have been
the result of the fire of the enemy, or the consequences
of an accident. The latter is possible, but
the former appears to us to be much the most probable.
The light seen by Captain Stewart and Lieutenant
Carrol, taken in connection with the circumstance
that the explosion occurred immediately after,
and apparently at that precise spot, is certainly an
incident worthy of our consideration, though it is not
easy to see how this light could have produced the
calamity. Accidents are much less likely to happen
on board such a vessel, than on ordinary occasions,
every care being taken to prevent them. As the intention
was to fire the splinters, all caution was doubtless
used to see that no loose powder was lying about,
and that the flames should not communicate with the
train, except at the right moment, and in the proper
manner. Still an accident from this source <span class='it'>may</span>
have occurred, through some unforeseen agency. If
this light was really on board the ketch it was probably
carried from aft, where it had been kept under
the eye of the officers, to the main-hatch in order to
kindle the splinters, a step that it was about time to
take. Commodore Preble, in his official letter,
adverts to the circumstance that this splinter-room
had not been set on fire when the ketch blew up, as
a proof that the party had been induced to act on an
emergency; for he always reasoned as if they blew
themselves up; believing that the Intrepid was surrounded,
and that many of the enemy were killed.
Reasoning on the same circumstance, with the knowledge
we now possess that no Turks were near, or
that any suffered, and it goes to show that the explosion
occurred at a moment when it was not expected
by Somers, who would not have neglected to fire this
room, in any ordinary case. If the accident had its
rise on board the ketch, it probably occurred in the
attempt to take this preliminary step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Intrepid may have been blown up, by
means of a shot from the enemy. This is the most
probable solution of the catastrophe, and the one
which is the most consoling to the friends of the
sufferers, and which ought to be the most satisfactory
to the nation. Commodore Preble says, “on entering
the harbor several shot were fired at her (the
Intrepid) from the batteries.” The western entrance,
in or near which the ketch blew up, is within
pistol shot of what is called the Spanish fort, or,
indeed, of most of the works on and about the mole.
Even the bashaw’s castle lies within fair canister
range of this spot, and, prepared as the Turks were
for any desperate enterprise on the part of the Americans,
nothing is more probable than that they jealously
watched the movements of a vessel that was
entering their harbor after dark, necessarily passing
near, if not coming directly from the American
squadron. These batteries may even have been provided
with hot shot, for any emergency like this.
Gunboat No. 8, Lieutenant Caldwell, was blown up
in the attack of the 7th August, and that very circumstance
would probably induce the Turks to make
a provision for repeating the injury. A cold shot,
however, might very well have caused the explosion.
The breaking of one of the shells on deck; the collision
with a bolt, a spike or even a nail in passing
through the hull, may have struck fire. It is possible
a shot passed through the splinter-room, and exposed
the powder of the train, and that in running below
with a lantern to ascertain what damage had been
done, the accident may have occurred. The moving
light seen by the present Commodore Stewart,
would favor such a supposition; though it must be
remembered this light may also have been on board
some vessel beyond the ketch, or even on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one other supposition has been made concerning
this melancholy affair. It has been thought
that the ketch grounded on the rocks, in the western
entrance, and was blown up there, to prevent the
enemy from getting possession of her powder. That
the Intrepid may have touched the rocks is not improbable,
the pass being laid down in the most accurate
chart of the harbor, as less than eighty fathoms
wide, with shoal water on each side, the visible rocks
being more than double that distance asunder; but
grounding does not infer the necessity of blowing up
the ketch’s crew. To suppose that Somers would
have destroyed himself through mortification, at finding
his vessel on shore, is opposed to reason and
probability; while it is doing gross injustice to a
character of singular chivalry and generosity to
believe he would have sacrificed his companions to
any consideration so strictly selfish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this case, as in all others, the simplest and
most natural solution of the difficulty is the most
probable. All the known facts of the case, too, help
to sustain this mode of reasoning. Those who saw
the ketch, think she was advancing to the lost
moment, while it is agreed she had not reached, by
several hundred yards, the spot to which it was the
intention to carry her. By the chart alluded to, one
recently made by an English officer of great merit,
it is about eleven hundred yards from the western entrance
to the bashaw’s castle, and about five hundred
and fifty to the inner harbor, or galley mole. Here,
close to windward of the enemy’s vessels, Somers
intended to have left the ketch, and there is no doubt
she would have drifted into their midst, when the
destruction must have been fearful. God disposed of
the result differently, for some wise purpose of his
own, rendering the assailants the sole victims of the
enterprise. It is only by considering the utter insignificance
of all temporal measures, as compared with
what lies beyond, that we can learn to submit to
these dispensations, with a just sense of our own
impotency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agree that the Intrepid blew up, in or quite
near to the western entrance. This was the result of
direct observation; it is proved by the fact that portions
of the wreck and some of the shells fell on the
rocks, and by the positions in which the Constitution’s
cutter and the bottom of the ketch were found. With
the wind at the eastward, the wreck could not have
“grounded on the <span class='it'>north</span> side of the rocks, near the
round battery,” as is stated in Commodore Bainbridge’s
private journal, had the Intrepid been any
distance <span class='it'>within</span> the entrance; nor would the Constitution’s
boat have drifted past the intervening objects
to the westward. The wind had probably a little
northing in it, following the line of coast, as is usual
with light airs, and, as is shown by the wreck’s
touching on the <span class='it'>north</span> side of the rocks, all of which
goes to prove, from an examination of the chart, as
well as from the evidence of those who were present,
that the accident occurred quite near the place
stated. Occurring so far out, with nothing near to
endanger the party, it leaves the moral certainly that
the explosion was the result of accident, and not of
design; or, if the latter, of an attempt of the enemy
to destroy the Intrepid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus perished Richard Somers, the subject of our
memoir, and one of the “bravest of the brave.”
Notwithstanding all our means of reasoning, and the
greatest efforts of human ingenuity, there will remain
a melancholy interest around the manner of his end,
which, by the Almighty will, is forever veiled from
human eyes in a sad and solemn mystery. In whatever
way we view the result, the service on which
he went was one of exceeding peril. He is known to
have volunteered for it, with readiness; to have made
his preparations with steadiness and alacrity; and,
when last seen, to have been entering on its immediate
execution, with a calm and intrepid serenity.
There was an ennobling motive, too, for undertaking
so great a risk. In addition to the usual inducements
of country and honor, the immediate liberation of
Bainbridge and his brave companions was believed
to depend on its success. Exaggerated notions of the
sufferings of the Philadelphia’s crew prevailed in the
squadron before Tripoli, as well as in the country,
and their brethren in arms fought with the double
incentive of duty and friendship. Ten minutes more
would probably have realized the fondest hopes of
the adventurers, but the providence of God was
opposed to their success, and the cause, if it is ever
to be known to man, must abide the revolutions that
await the end of time, and the commencement of
eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In person, Somers was a man of middle stature—rather
below than above it—but stout of frame; exceedingly
active, and muscular. His nose was inclining
to the aquiline, his eyes and hair were dark,
and his whole face bore marks of the cross of the
French blood that was said to run in his veins. It is
a remarkable circumstance in the career of this distinguished
young officer, that no one has any thing to
urge against him. He was mild, amiable and affectionate,
both in disposition and deportment, though of
singularly chivalrous notions of duty and honor. It has
been said by a writer who has had every opportunity
of ascertaining the fact, that when a very young
man he fought three duels in one day—almost at the
same time—being wounded himself in the two first,
and fighting the last, seated on the ground, sustained
by his friend Decatur. Although such an incident
could only have occurred with very young men, and
perhaps under the exaggerations of a very young
service, it was perfectly characteristic of Somers.
There was nothing vindictive in these duels. He
fired but once at each adversary—he wounded the
last man—and was himself, in a physical sense, the
principal sufferer. The quarrels arose from his opponents
imputing to him a want of spirit for not resenting
some idle expression of Decatur’s, who was the
last man living to intend to hurt Somers’ feelings.
They loved each other as brothers, and Decatur
proved it, by offering to fight the two last duels for
his friend, after the latter had received his first
wound. But Somers fought for honor, and was determined
that the men who doubted him, should be
convinced of their mistake. Apart from the error
of continuing the affairs after the first injury, and the
general moral mistake of supposing that a moral
injury can be repaired in this mode at all, these
duels had the chivalrous character that should ever
characterize such meetings, if meetings of this
nature are really necessary to human civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it is scarcely possible that a warm-hearted
young man, like Somers, should not have felt a preference
for some person of the other sex, it is not
known that he had any serious attachment when he
lost his life. Glory appears to have been his mistress,
for the time being at least, and he led no one
of this nature behind him to mourn his early loss. He
died possessed of a respectable landed property, and
one of increasing value; all of which he bequeathed
to the only sister mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somers was thought to be an expert seaman, by
those who were good judges of such qualifications.
As a commander he was mild, but sufficiently firm.
His education, without being unusual even in his profession
at that day, had not been neglected, though
he would not probably have been classed among the
reading men of the service. A chivalrous sense of
honor, an unmoved courage, and perfect devotion to
the service in which he was engaged, formed the
prominent points of his character, and as all were
accompanied by great gentleness of manner and
amiability of feeling, he appears to have been equally
beloved and respected. The attachment which
existed between him and Decatur had something
romantic about it. They were rivals in professional
daring, while they were bosom friends. As we have
already said, it is by no means improbable that the
exploits of Decatur induced Somers, through a
generous competition, to engage in the perilous enterprise
in which he perished, and on which he
entered with a known intention of yielding up his life,
if necessary to prevent the enemy’s obtaining the
great advantage of demanding ransom for his party,
or of seizing the powder in the ketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Congress passed a resolution of condolence with
the friends of the officers who died in the Intrepid, as
well as with those of all the officers who fell before
Tripoli. Of these brave men, Somers, on account of
his rank, the manner of his death, and his previous
exploits, has stood foremost with the country and
the service. These claims justly entitle him to
this high distinction. Among all the gallant young
men that this war first made known to the nation, he
has always maintained a high place, and, as it is a
station sealed with his blood, it has become sacred to
the entire republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a proof of the estimation in which this
regretted officer is held, that several small vessels
have since been called after him. Perry had a
schooner, which was thus designated, under his
orders on the memorable 10th September, 1813; and a
beautiful little brig has lately been put into the water
on the seaboard, which is called the Somers. In
short, his name has passed into a watchword in
the American navy; and as they who are first associated
with the annals of a nation, whether in connection
with its institutions, its arms, its literature, or
its arts, form the germs of all its future renown, it
is probable it will be handed down to posterity, as
one of the bright examples which the aspiring
and daring in their country’s service will do well to
imitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident related in the following lines is recorded of a young British officer, commanding at Fort Mackinaw, soon
after the French war. His name was Robinson; and the cliff, from which the enraged Indian sprung with his daughter,
rising to three hundred feet above the water, is called, to this day, <span class='sc'>Robinson’s Folly</span>. They had been married about
two weeks when the tragical event took place.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Whereon the evening sun is shining,</p>
<p class='line0'>With woods, and bannered fortress brave,</p>
<p class='line0'>And chalky cliff, and scallop cave,</p>

<p class='line0'>And, winding wild, with forests green,</p>
<p class='line0'>Low banks, and lonely coves unseen,</p>
<p class='line0'>Stretch wide away, on either hand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shores fair as an enchanted land.</p>

<p class='line0'>Ah, me! there is no spot of earth,</p>

<p class='line0'>Of all the sons of Tarke<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> none</p>
<p class='line0'>In battle braver deeds had done,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or mightier in the council sat</p>
<p class='line0'>Where chieftains joined the deep debate,</p>
<p class='line0'>Than proud Peechiki. He had trod</p>
<p class='line0'>With Pontiac on the path of blood;</p>
<p class='line0'>With Pontiac had at every chance</p>
<p class='line0'>Still struggled for the love of France;</p>
<p class='line0'>With Pontiac in the battle’s crash</p>
<p class='line0'>Hewed down the hated Sagaunash;<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>
<p class='line0'>And when his last the Ottowa breathed,</p>
<p class='line0'>To stern Peechiki was bequeathed</p>
<p class='line0'>A hidden hatred—such as burns</p>
<p class='line0'>Where Ætna’s heart to ashes turns.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But suddenly a terror came,</p>
<p class='line0'>A swift disease of fearful name.</p>
<p class='line0'>All whom he loved, or could have wept,</p>
<p class='line0'>One hour beheld to darkness swept—</p>
<p class='line0'>All but his youngest, fairest child,</p>
<p class='line0'>On which the mother dying smiled,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet Wintemoyeh, sweetest flower,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lone lingerer in his rifled bower,</p>
<p class='line0'>The loveliest far of Tarke’s daughters</p>
<p class='line0'>Beside St. Mary’s rushing waters.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And now beyond their empty home</p>
<p class='line0'>No more the mourning sire would roam,</p>
<p class='line0'>But all his moody hours employ</p>
<p class='line0'>In hovering near his only joy.</p>
<p class='line0'>So sweet to gaze upon her face,</p>
<p class='line0'>Why should his foot the wild deer trace?</p>
<p class='line0'>So light her step green leaves among,</p>
<p class='line0'>Why should he seek the warrior throng?</p>
<p class='line0'>Or where could tones so soft and clear</p>
<p class='line0'>Make music to his aged ear?</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! thus to love can only be</p>
<p class='line0'>Refined, absorbing misery!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But cloudy years were gathering fast,</p>
<p class='line0'>And ere they should their shadows cast</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon his grave, the sole, fair flower</p>
<p class='line0'>He would might grace some chieftain’s bower.</p>
<p class='line0'>And when, to woo her for his bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Children-of-the-Reindeer’s pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Great Assiboin, his love gifts bore:</p>
<p class='line0'>From far Superior’s farthest shore,</p>
<p class='line0'>The father gave her youthful age,</p>
<p class='line0'>With joy, to be his heritage.</p>
<p class='line0'>For who like him could hunt the roe?</p>
<p class='line0'>Who track so fast a flying foe?</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose feet by lake and lonely glen</p>
<p class='line0'>So oft had led his dauntless men</p>
<p class='line0'>From Mississippi’s haunted cave</p>
<p class='line0'>To Saskatchawan’s gloomy wave?</p>
<p class='line0'>Beloved by one so brave as he</p>
<p class='line0'>How happy would her portion be!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>In truth, he was a warrior bold,</p>
<p class='line0'>But wedded, ugly, fierce and old,</p>
<p class='line0'>To maiden’s heart a terror, were</p>
<p class='line0'>No brighter image worshiped there:</p>
<p class='line0'>And ah! the maid had chanced to see</p>
<p class='line0'>A face that lived in memory!</p>
<p class='line0'>The wild flowers of the early spring</p>
<p class='line0'>Her gentle hands were gathering,</p>
<p class='line0'>When lo! before her gazing stood</p>
<p class='line0'>A pale-face in the leafy wood.</p>
<p class='line0'>And as she looked upon him there,</p>
<p class='line0'>So young, so proud, so nobly fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>A thrill of strange emotion stole</p>
<p class='line0'>In tremblings through her timid soul.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet turned she not—and then he took</p>
<p class='line0'>His seat beside her, where the brook</p>
<p class='line0'>Ran rippling o’er its pebbly bed;</p>
<p class='line0'>And soft and earnest things he said</p>
<p class='line0'>With broken words and many a sign</p>
<p class='line0'>That only Love could e’er divine.</p>
<p class='line0'>He was a white man—hated race!</p>
<p class='line0'>But ah! what looks, what winning grace!</p>
<p class='line0'>And who such gentle words could say?</p>
<p class='line0'>Her simple heart was stol’n away!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The hideous bridegroom comes at last⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The feast is gorged—the night is past⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>At morn behold the father lie</p>
<p class='line0'>In writhing, wildered agony!</p>
<p class='line0'>He hastes the nuptials that his eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>May see her blest before he dies:</p>
<p class='line0'>Alas! her father’s couch of pain!</p>
<p class='line0'>But how with such a spouse remain?</p>
<p class='line0'>Poor girl! how sad the lot that laid</p>
<p class='line0'>Such choice upon a guileless maid!</p>
<p class='line0'>She trembles—flees—that gentle being⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Her lover clasps her—trembling—fleeing.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>An April day was hers—so brief,</p>
<p class='line0'>With tears and sunshine, joy and grief.</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the island’s lofty verge,</p>
<p class='line0'>That overhangs the chiding surge,</p>
<p class='line0'>Within a sylvan bower, arrayed</p>
<p class='line0'>Of cedars green and woven shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>In festive mirth with comrades boon,</p>
<p class='line0'>The lover sat, from radiant noon</p>
<p class='line0'>Till shadowy eve: and by him smiled</p>
<p class='line0'>Fair Wintemoyeh, now beguiled</p>
<p class='line0'>Of thought by melting music wild;</p>
<p class='line0'>Love keeping watch in her dark eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>How fast the speaking moments fly!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Now sank the sun, but lingering gave</p>
<p class='line0'>Last looks of love each rising wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>That wooed his smile—when suddenly</p>
<p class='line0'>A rifle rang, and, bounding high</p>
<p class='line0'>In baffled rage, as, with a yell,</p>
<p class='line0'>By death-bolt at the lover sped,</p>
<p class='line0'>Another than his victim fell,</p>
<p class='line0'>The father, minister of dread,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whom wrath had rescued from the dead,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dashed through the revel—seized his child⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Yelled in her frighted ear “defiled!”</p>
<p class='line0'>At one stride bore her to the ledge,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then, turning darkly on the edge,</p>
<p class='line0'>His clenched hand shook. The lover sprung</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To save his love. With whoop and whirl,</p>
<p class='line0'>Far from the cliff exulting flung,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The savage bore the wretched girl;</p>
<p class='line0'>And as to every gazing eye</p>
<p class='line0'>They gleamed, like meteor hurled from high,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wild rose through mid air to the sky</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>His</span> cry of triumph, <span class='it'>hers</span> of terror:</p>
<p class='line0'>Down, down, careering, headlong borne,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dashed on the rocks, disjointed, torn,</p>
<p class='line0'>The chieftain found his vengeance sworn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The maid atoned her first, last error.</p>
<p class='line0'>The waves, the broken rocks that lave,</p>
<p class='line0'>Received them to a restless grave,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose mangled forms, unclasping never,</p>
<p class='line0'>Move with the moving tide forever.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A TALE OF RICHELIEU.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “HENRI QUATRE; OR THE DAYS OF THE LEAGUE.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>(Continued from page 141.)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had cause of self congratulation in the
issue of the second interview with the all powerful
Richelieu. Difficulties, which the imagination paints
as an Herculean labor to remove, shrink to trifles
when the will is resolute and stern necessity impels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dread audience over, she flew with the intelligence
to the zealous and faithful advocate, but when
the first tumult of the mind had subsided, there was
much to ponder over ere she could meet Monsieur
Giraud. What account could be rendered concerning
the page? Would he not question, and perhaps
tax her with imprudence, and misplaced confidence?
And was there no one else, fair Marguerite, interested?
No question to ask thy own heart?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richelieu’s page was daring, reckless, and seemingly
a very unscrupulous youth, following the impulses
of his will even to the periling of liberty and
life! Yet her heart pleaded in his favor—the homage
he paid was flattering—even the peril was incurred
for her sake—and though their first rencontre was
humiliating to her delicacy, and strangely indecorous
on his part, yet, ere parting, it must be confessed that
the rudeness had been forgiven, and his frankness
and sincerity won favor. We will not say how far
atonement was rendered easier in the culprit by the
advantages of a handsome figure, youthful tresses and
the fire of a proud dark eye!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could she with honor, even with safety, expose his
secret to the advocate? Nay, to confess that her intelligence
was derived from a page in a confidential
interview, would it not bring more blushes to the
cheek than being exposed to the gaze of the score of
cavaliers who environed Richelieu?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be thought of—yet must the intelligence
be communicated to the worthy Giraud—it
was even so intended by François himself, although
in terms so flattering to her discretion, he left the
means to the maiden’s own judgment, making no
stipulation, merely the memento that life and liberty
were in her hands. And ought they not to be held
sacred? Yes! even the very shadow of his name
should be secret, no allusion escape her lips, which
might in the slightest degree compromise the youth,
even to so trusty a friend as Giraud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advocate was at home, waiting anxiously her
appearance, for to-morrow would the sharp <span class='it'>procureur</span>
pray for the decree of sequestration, and the venal
president doubtless affirm it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not taken his advice, but preferred a second
appeal to the flinty cardinal rather than beseech
the king’s interference. Yet had she been successful!
He was delighted, prayed that every particular
might be narrated, exclaimed that no such maiden
had graced the lineage of De Pontis these five centuries
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gravely bidding the learned man cool his ardor,
and take repose in the easy chair, the oracular seat
in which he gave audience to clients, she detailed
the circumstances of the meeting with the cardinal
in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who pointed out to Mademoiselle the locality?
Who dictated the stratagem—for such it appeared to
be—as the garden was not the usual gate of egress to
the minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These questions the maiden solemnly declared that
she must not answer—under whosever guidance she
had acted, Monsieur Giraud might perceive that it
had been successful. He must not even make further
inquiries, or she would withhold secrets yet in store.
It was not perhaps delicate or befitting, that one of
her age should obtain intelligence from sources which
she dare not reveal to her father, or her father’s
friend—yet Monsieur Giraud must remember that the
<span class='it'>rôle</span> she played in the affair was altogether unsuitable
to her sex, and parental affection alone had stimulated
her to endure what she had undergone. As the
advocate had encouraged the resolution, he must not
complain of an inevitable consequence—as she had
ventured on a business, and strayed into haunts fitting
only a man to explore, it must be permitted her to
retain a privilege of manhood—the keeping her own
secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answering this positive declaration,
so the wondering, but good natured lawyer, shifted
ground, and requested a recital of such secrets as he
might be permitted to hear. At the mention of the
Count De Fontrailles, a flush overspread his pale
face, and when Mademoiselle had concluded the
narration, he sat awhile in deep thought. “Fontrailles!”
cried the advocate, breaking silence, “he
was one of three whom I suspected—but I am glad
he is the man, for if I mistake not, I hold that which
will ruin him with the cardinal. Shall we consult
with Monsieur De Pontis to-morrow morning? I
might obtain an order at the bureau this evening.
No! he is useless to our plans. Mademoiselle and
myself, and,” he added, looking significantly at the
maiden, “her unknown friend, with his budget of
secrets, are a trio equal to the emergency. But tell
me, Marguerite, have you not been to the Tuileries
to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She assured him that she had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then my conjectures are all vain,” cried Giraud,
“but let us to council.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed out with clearness the position in which
the affairs of De Pontis now stood in relation to all
the parties with whom he was unfortunately engaged.
The suit of Pedro Olivera gave but little concern.
If all the presidents of that court were not biased,
he thought he should be able to disprove the equity of
Pedro’s claim, through documents in his possession,
or failing this he could produce many sets-off, moneys
lent to the claimant of which he acknowledged no
account, of itself tending to cast suspicion on the
suitor, and at any rate convict him of dishonesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it mattered little what became of Pedro’s suit,
if the estate of De Pontis, together with the <span class='it'>droit
d’aubaine</span>, were sequestered by the <span class='it'>procureur’s</span>
decree in the meanwhile. The week’s grace would
afford the opportunity wanted to arrange a plan of
operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if Monsieur should lay these papers before
the cardinal, is he sure that it would effect the count’s
ruin?—he may be so necessary, that his eminence
cannot part with him,” remarked the damsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very pertinent question,” cried Giraud, “but
still betraying ignorance of a proper procedure with
Fontrailles. If I went to his eminence, and succeeded
in ruining the favorite, that would not likely
stop Pedro’s suit, or the <span class='it'>procureur’s</span> proceedings, as
the cardinal is now embittered personally against
Monsieur De Pontis, and might divert the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span>
to some other channel than the treacherous
count, Mademoiselle’s unknown friend for instance,
whom I am persuaded holds the keys of the cardinal
duke’s cabinet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite blushed, but made no reply, and the
advocate continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Effectually to serve my good friend, I must make
Fontrailles so tremble in his shoes at the very idea of
the ruin I hold over his head, that he shall himself
intercede with Richelieu to cancel all the court’s
proceedings, and leave your father in peaceful
possession of the <span class='it'>droit</span>. These are the terms I shall
offer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how will the count get over the surprise of
his eminence at what will appear such extraordinary
conduct on his part?” asked Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Mademoiselle has had longer experience
in the haunts into which she strayed,” replied the
advocate, “more communings with her all-wise
secret friend, she will not need be told that when a
man of Fontraille’s stamp has chosen a line of conduct,
nothing is easier than to assign a motive for it.
I have no positive objection, if he need such aid, that
we should give the count a helping hand on that
point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what remains to be done?” asked Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but for your humble servant to arm himself
for conflict with the dark-souled intriguer,”
replied the advocate, smiling; “it will be a desperate
strife, I can assure Mademoiselle, a hard struggle ere
the count, overwhelmed with debts, and panting for
the rich effects of the Spaniard, will yield the prey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what part shall I take in the contest?” said
the maiden, “how can I aid Monsieur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have little doubt,” replied the advocate, taking
the damsel’s hand, and raising it to his lips with an
air of gallantry, “that this soft hand has been pressed
before to-day, but if a grave man in years, like myself,
were to repeat the foolish things that were said
over it, as for instance, that to press such a treasure
to my lips, were overpaying me for all the secrets I
disclosed, I have little doubt that for me to say so,
would look very silly! You blush, Marguerite, it is
very hard to deceive an old advocate, our profession
is learned in the world’s ways. But beware,
Mademoiselle! beware! danger lurks in the precincts
of courts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Monsieur faith in my discretion?” asked
Marguerite, smiling through her blushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” replied Giraud with earnestness, “and
I am about to afford such proof of it, as might with
many men rank me as one capable of acting with
deliberate folly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then informed Marguerite, what had not before
struck her, that in attacking Fontrailles, he ran risk in
many shapes, even of personal danger; he might lose
his life in bearding the count in his own hotel. Every
species of menace and intimidation would be undoubtedly
employed to silence one armed, like the
advocate, with documents threatening ruin; these
failing, personal violence might be resorted to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Marguerite! look not so pale,” said Giraud,
whose language had awakened extreme terror in the
maiden, “I am a bachelor, and my life would be
well lost in defending a just cause—but the count, I
believe, would venture on a different system, though
equally desperate. It appears your unknown friend
confirms what we have all surmised respecting these
papers, and when I acknowledge possession he will,
I have reason to fear, avail of some scheme of villany
to dispossess me. No means, however reckless,
will he fail of using. If I loose the proofs of his
treachery my weapon is broken—and then farewell
the cause of De Pontis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is this to be avoided? O! go not near
such a man!” cried Marguerite, distressed and
alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advocate laughed at her fears. He knew, he
said, whom he had to deal with too well to venture
into the arena of conflict unprepared. That he might
not be deprived by force of the documents, it were
necessary that they should no longer remain in his
custody—nor would he meet the count till he knew
they were in the hands of a party who would still
hold them <span class='it'>in terrorem</span> over Richelieu’s favorite,
should he, Giraud, be kidnapped, thrown into prison,
or otherwise disposed of. And that his safety might
rest on securer footing, he should take especial care
to let Fontrailles understand that whatever became
of the humble advocate the haughty noble had not removed
one iota of the peril which menaced himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whom could he trust? Not De Pontis, for the
veteran had neither place of concealment for them,
nor freedom to make an active use of the weapons
should circumstances require it. And whom else
confide in? Certainly none of his professional
brethren—and he had no near kinsman, save De
Pontis—nor did he know any friend of the latter to
whom he could delegate the trust, for the veteran
had been abandoned when Richelieu became his foe.
Marguerite herself was eminently trustworthy, but
the papers could not remain, even with the shadow
of safety, in her possession—her lodging would undoubtedly
be subjected to a domiciliary visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet he was about to confide the charge to her,
but with the condition that it be immediately transferred
to sure hands, and to one who had the courage
and heart to stand in his place should he fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Marguerite De Pontis, how weighty
will be the responsibility,” said he, “and yet, I confess,
I know not what other course to pursue. As
you have not made me your confidant, I know not
all your friends—but if you are aware of none other
to whom so precious a charge can be conveyed, involving
your father’s, your own, and my fortunes,
then place the papers in the hands of his majesty—he
is no match for the cardinal or Fontrailles either—but
he has pledged himself to Monsieur De Pontis,
and his faith is good though his courage be poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then handed her the rather bulky packet, repeating
the injunction, if she were cognizant of no abler
or trustier friend, to make Louis the depositary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am acting strangely,” said the advocate, “in
permitting Mademoiselle, so young, to choose her
own and her father’s champion, but I feel an impulse
to which I yield without strictly satisfying my reason.
When Marguerite informs me that the packet is
transferred, then I go forth to the encounter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kissing her forehead, he bade the damsel farewell.
Concealing the packet under her mantle, the tears
starting to her eyes at the solemnity of the injunction,
she retraced her way sadly to the <span class='it'>Rue St. Denis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the solitude of her chamber—only broken by
the occasional entrance of the aged female, the last
link of a once numerous household—she had much
to reflect on. The noble, though eccentric, behavior
of Giraud; the proud Richelieu, serene and tranquil
even in his implacability; the poor, weak Louis; the
dark, intriguing Fontrailles; and, lastly, the page,
with his sudden birth of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it a dream? Was she Marguerite De Pontis,
daughter of a poor gentleman of Limousin, and
so deeply involved in the thickening strife of the
master intellects of France? It was even so—the
fatal packet met her eyes, cause of past, present and
future contest—and her own destiny it was to cast
the firebrand at the enemies which beset her imprisoned
father!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst indulging these meditations, the tinkling
bell of the <span class='it'>houblieur</span>, or itinerant dealer in wafer
cakes, fell upon her ear. She started from the reverie,
and, hastening to the door, beheld the slim vender,
apron tied round the waist, basket on arm, and bell
in hand, seemingly more anxious to attract a customer
from the lodging of De Pontis than solicitous
to dispose of his cakes to the frequenters of the <span class='it'>Rue
St. Denis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving the door open, he made no hesitation
in entering, although Marguerite had been careful
not to expose herself to view. The noise, however,
attracted old Marie, bringing her from her retreat in
the domestic offices of the domicil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Virgin!” cried the ancient dame, “there is
a man in the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>ma bonne mère</span>!” said the disguised page,
“and he has a tongue which will rival the loudest
gossip in the <span class='it'>Rue St. Denis</span>;” and thereupon the
youth commenced ringing his bell violently, to the
extreme vexation of Marguerite, and the astonishment
of the old crone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alarmed at the noise, and the unexpected apparition
in the gloom, the old woman shouted for help.
The damsel knew not what to do, or how to explain
the matter to her ancient retainer—something must
be done to silence both parties, so suddenly seizing
the bell, she wrested it from his grasp; then approaching
the old woman, she spoke in a loud whisper
that the man was not what he appeared to be,
that he came on her father’s business by direction of
Monsieur Giraud, and that the visit must be kept
secret. With these words she quieted and dismissed
Marie, and then turning to the youth, said disdainfully,
that she was much beholden for his services—that
their second meeting was in strict keeping with
their first rencontre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Mademoiselle,” said François, apologizing,
“but I am in such good spirits that my joy
cannot contain itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such feelings may agree with the prosperity of
the <span class='it'>Palais-Cardinal</span>,” replied Marguerite, “but you
are now in a house of mourning, and it will be so as
long as my poor father lies in the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course Marguerite was embarked on necessitated
courage and decision, nor was she deficient.
Without fear, or at least without betraying any, she
led the youth to the <span class='it'>salle</span>, or parlor, and requesting
him to be seated, said she was afraid that more discretion
than he possessed would be requisite to aid
her father. Still she was very grateful for the interview
with the cardinal, obtained, as she confessed,
solely through his directions; also for the clue to the
machinations of the Count De Fontrailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been employed alone both in Germany and
in England, young as I appear to be, and on the cardinal’s
business,” said the page, in rather a haughty
tone, “and his eminence is not the man to employ
those in his affairs who lack discretion. Does my
present garb indicate want of precaution, or imply
foresight? I appeal to Mademoiselle’s candor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But consider, sir—consider, Monsieur Romainville,”
exclaimed Marguerite, “if the troubles of our
family should have led me to place confidence in a
stranger, does that warrant him in entering our house
in a style and with a noise calculated to bring observation
and remarks on my conduct?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose there were a disposition to scandal, which
Heaven forbid!” replied the youth, “the real object
of my visit would still be masked. In the short period
which I hope will terminate Monsieur De Pontis’
imprisonment, it were even better that I were
suspected wrongly than my real motives guessed at.
But I have not unfolded my news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then informed the damsel that the Count De
Fontrailles was in attendance on the cardinal when
he left the palace, and of course heard Mademoiselle’s
petition and the favorable though sarcastic reply of
the minister. A little scene of remonstrance and
replication occurred afterwards, as the page knew,
though he would not say how he became possessed of
the information, between patron and dependent, in
the course of which the cardinal rallying his favorite,
declared the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span> was worth another
week’s waiting, and the affairs of De Pontis would
stand at the expiration exactly where they did. The
count left the presence much disappointed, remarking
that he was happy to find Monseigneur regaining
the feelings of youth—if a taste for beauty were a
criterion. Richelieu only smiled, for the count was
a useful man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsewhere, Fontrailles swore horribly at the delay,
and vowed vengeance against all who stood in the
way of his desires. His creditors were gaping for
their claims, and there were debts of honor unpaid.
This statement Mademoiselle might rely on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” exclaimed Marguerite, “I tremble for
my father’s kind friend, Monsieur Giraud, he will
fall a sacrifice to the count’s rage. It is far better
we should abandon the <span class='it'>droit</span> than expose so worthy
a man to peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In explanation, she ventured to inform François of
the advocate’s intention. But Pedro Olivera’s statement
of claim on Fontrailles—where was it? demanded
the youth eagerly. The maiden was silent!
Had she disclosed aught concerning himself to Monsieur
Giraud? Marguerite repeated what had passed
on that topic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Romainville, who observed her hesitation,
assured her that in aught which concerned her
father’s affairs she might safely confide in him. He
did not profess to be disinterested—he might even
claim a boon, but on this point would be silent till
M. De Pontis were liberated. That she might know
the history of one who asked her confidence, he related
that his father had been sacrificed by a similar
juggle to that attempted against Monsieur, and for the
benefit of the same party, Fontrailles. The count
pretending to pity his orphan state—and well he
might, as he had himself wrought the calamity—recommended
him to the cardinal. He served his eminence,
it is true, and on occasions usefully, but
hatred to the two prominent authors of his father’s
ruin was not diminished thereby; and this feeling
had twice produced a refractoriness leading to incarceration
in the guard-room of the <span class='it'>Palais-Cardinal</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sympathizing with De Pontis, detesting Fontrailles
and the tyrannical Richelieu—but for whom he might
still have had a parent alive, and been himself very
different from the reckless scapegrace he was now
accounted—he might, he thought, be fairly trusted
with any scheme which promised revenge on either
the count or his patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Giraud, he said, acted wisely in attacking
Fontrailles in the way pointed out, but there was one
matter which it behoved him to take care of with the
count, which was to have especial regard that he be
not robbed of the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite replied that that subject had been
already considered by the advocate, and he had bestowed
the papers elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not safe from Fontrailles with Mademoiselle
De Pontis,” said the page, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would they be safe with the Sieur De Romainville
in the <span class='it'>Palais-Cardinal</span>?” asked the maiden
significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so safe as this hand is from my lips!” exclaimed
François, suiting the action to the word and
kneeling at her feet; “if Mademoiselle permit⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That she remind him of his promise not to show
interested motives till her father be free,” cried Marguerite,
interrupting him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I had forgotten it!” said the page, laughing
and springing to his feet; “but before I depart
let me give proof of disinterestedness, at least to one
of the household. Let Marie have this cargo of
wafers, it will requite the alarm and may help to
stop her mouth. The basket I shall want again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, he upset the entire stock in trade on the
table, and replacing the basket on his left arm, seized
the hand-bell, which Marguerite construing into an
intention of inflicting another serenade on the quiet
household, cried,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my sake, Monsieur, forbear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can assure Mademoiselle I shall not be guilty a
second time of such folly,” replied François, “but I
was so delighted with the check given to Fontrailles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In place of the wafers, he took with him the
packet, and the good wishes of her who had given it
in charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many are poets who have never penned their
inspiration;” and still more truly might it be said,
“Many are lovers who have never breathed their
adoration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there be much “unwritten poetry” in the world,
there is also much <span class='it'>unuttered love</span>, much that should
have been spoken to hearts where it would have
found a response, much that would have contributed
to honor and happiness, much that has existed in
secrecy and silence, glimmering, like the lamp in an
ancient sepulchre, only over the ashes of departed
hopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Allison was one of those persons who are
usually considered “lucky men,” though his luck lay
in his industry, perseverance and economy, while
the talisman which secured his success was most
probably inscribed with the word, “<span class='it'>Patience</span>.” He
had grown rich slowly, not from the sudden influx of
speculative wealth, but by the gradual accumulations
of toilsome years, and his progress from poverty to
riches had been marked by no startling transitions.
Upright in all his dealings, and justly conscious of
his own native respectability, he sought no devious
ways to fortune, and, when her favors were gained,
he aimed at no ostentatious display of them. He
lived in plain but handsome style, spared no expense
in the education of his family, gratified them with
every luxury that was consistent with his ideas of
propriety, and, contrary to the practice of most American
merchants, indulged <span class='it'>himself</span> with sufficient
leisure even amid the cares of business, to enjoy
the society of his wife, his children and his friends.
Remembering his own early struggles, he was always
ready to extend a helping hand to the young and unfriended,
so that many a poor boy, who now enjoys
the blessings of competence, has looked back with
joy to the day which brought him within the notice
of the benevolent merchant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among those whom Mr. Allison had most efficiently
aided was a youth, named Ernest Melvyn,
who, when scarcely fourteen years of age, had been
so fortunate as to secure a situation in his warehouse.
In little more than two years after he entered Mr.
Allison’s employ the boy had the misfortune to lose
his father, and thus the maintenance of a sick mother
and an almost infant sister devolved upon him. Mr.
Allison, with that promptness which always doubles
the value of a generous act, immediately promoted
Ernest to a more responsible station, and increased
his salary, while he appropriated to the use of the
widowed mother comfortable apartments in one of
his own houses. But his kindness did not stop here.
Finding that the family of his young clerk were
highly respectable though now reduced to great
indigence, and that the boy’s early education had
been suited rather to his father’s former station than
to his present fortunes, Mr. Allison determined to give
him every advantage in the prosecution of his studies.
He invited Ernest to his house, gave him the use of
his library, directed him to the most instructive books,
and, in short, left nothing undone which could contribute
to his future welfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deeply grateful to his benefactor for all his kindness,
and fully sensible of the importance of such
advantages, Ernest showed his thankfulness both by
his close attention to his duties, and his ready acceptance
of Mr. Allison’s offers. He became a regular
resident in the family; a timid, quiet, unobtrusive
haunter of that pleasant fireside, where he always
found a kind welcome, cheerful companions and excellent
books. Every body liked him, from the merchant,
who was pleased with his fidelity to business,
and Mrs. Allison, who found him very useful in the
execution of those thousand little commissions of
which husbands are so provokingly forgetful, down
to the smiling servant maid who opened the door at
the knock of the pale and pleasant-faced clerk. His
quiet cheerfulness and unruffled good-temper made
him a great favorite with Mr. Allison’s daughters,
but his most especial friend in the family was the
“youngling of the flock,” the petted and lovely little
Mary. Though scarcely four years old when Ernest
became so associated with them, Mary attached herself
to him, with all the warmth of childish affection.
Ernest loved her for her resemblance to his own little
sister, who had been the idol of his boyhood, and
who had early followed his father to the grave. He
seemed to have transferred to Mary Allison the love
which had once been lavished upon his lost darling,
and fondly did the child respond to his tenderness.
She was in truth one of the loveliest of creatures,
with large, soft, blue eyes, a profusion of golden
curls, and lips like the berries of the cornel-tree,
while her frank and joyous temper, her sunny cheerfulness,
and the overflowing affection which seemed
ever gushing up from the depths of her innocent
heart, added new charms to her infantine beauty.
She was the idol of her parents, the delight of her
elder sisters, the plaything of the servants, and, above
all, the cherished pet of Ernest Melvyn. Hour after
hour would he sit with Mary nestled upon his knee,
while he displayed to her wondering gaze the beautiful
engravings in her father’s costly volumes, or
traced on her little slate many a rough but spirited
sketch of castle and cottage, to be effaced and
renewed with every childish whim. He carved fairy
baskets of cherry-pits, fashioned clay models of
Indian figures, and practiced, for the gratification of
his favorite, those thousand little devices which can
be accomplished by a skilful hand, good taste and
patience. When infancy gave place to childhood,
with its increasing cares, it was Ernest Melvyn who
became the confidant of all little Mary’s anxieties
and pleasures. It was he who wrought out the tedious
sum, and explained the wonderfully abstruse rules of
that hated grammar, and aided her in remembering
those troublesome chronological tables, and, in short,
removed every stumbling-block, while he lightened
every burden of her school life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the mean time Mr. Allison’s elder daughters
were growing up to womanhood, as beautiful as they
were gentle and good. Their personal attractions,
their gracefully feminine characters, and the known
wealth of their father, all contributed to draw around
them a crowd of admirers, whose motives were as
various as their minds. Amid such persons Ernest
never mingled. Retiring in his manners, and humble
in his feelings, he never obtruded himself into the
gay circle which gradually formed itself around the
young ladies. His visits were as frequent as ever,
but his evenings were usually passed in the library,
aiding Mary in her lessons, giving her such primary
instructions in drawing, as his fine but uncultivated
taste would permit, or reading some useful book,
which, if rather above the child’s comprehension,
was yet listened to with pleasure because Ernest was
the reader. Mr. Allison beheld with pleasure the innocent
attachment which existed between them. He
believed it to be an advantage to both, since it gave
Mary a new impulse and aid to mental cultivation,
while it preserved Ernest from many of the
temptations which assail the youth of a large city;
and even the prudence of age could see nothing to
fear from the affection which had thus been awakened
in the days of infancy. But the love which had thus
sprung up between the child of four summers, and
the boy of sixteen, had lost none of its tenderness
when Mary could count her twelfth birthday. “How
I love,” says the Ettrick Shepherd, “how I love a little
girl of twelve;” and those who have made children a
study will heartily agree with him. It is the sweetest
of all ages, the loveliest of all periods in woman’s
life: because it is perhaps the only season when the
developing mind and expanding heart display their
beautiful feminine traits without one shadow from the
coming cloud of passion, when the flowers of affection
give out their richest perfume, unmingled with
the envenomed sweets with which future years will
imbue them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest Melvyn had grown up tall and handsome,
but with the pale cheek and thoughtful brow of the
habitual thinker. His eyes were usually veiled
beneath their full and drooping lids, but they were
full of intelligence and sweetness, while his form
was as graceful and his step as free as if he had
never trod other soil than that of the green hills
where his sunny hours of childhood had been passed.
His application to business had given him a degree
of gravity beyond his years, and his love of reading
had made him a quiet observer of society rather than
an actor in its busy scenes. His time was divided
between his duties in the warehouse, his attention to
his infirm mother, and his visits to Mr. Allison’s
family; the first tended to create stability of character,
the second to cultivate the domestic affections, and
quicken his delicate sense of duty, while the last
gave him the inestimable advantage of polished and
virtuous female society. Could he have overcome
his reserve, and learned to think less humbly of himself,
Ernest Melvyn might have shone in the gayest
circles, for, even in a place where wealth too often
determines a man’s social position, the protégé of
the rich Mr. Allison would have found little difficulty
in winning his way. Had Ernest understood the
“<span class='it'>art of pushing</span>,” an art, by the way, which deserves
to be made the subject of a course of lectures, he
could easily have become a general favorite in society,
and might, in all probability, by some fortunate
marriage, have compassed what the world pleasantly
calls “<span class='it'>Independence</span>,” in other words, a lifelong
subsistence upon the alimony of a wife. But Ernest
was too modest, too single-minded to think of such
things. The liberal stipend which he received from
Mr. Allison more than sufficed for all his mother’s
necessities, and his own wants were very few. A
small sum was annually left in his benefactor’s hands,
to form a fund for his mother’s future support in case
of his death, and with this provision he was perfectly
content. As his tastes developed, his gradually
increasing means enabled him to gratify them without
encroaching upon this consecrated hoard. Books,
purchased chiefly at auction, and remarkable rather
for their solid worth, than their exterior decorations,
had accumulated around him, a few choice paintings
which he had found among the rubbish of a deceased
picture dealer, now adorned the walls of his neat
apartment, a collection of minerals, made with no
other expense than that of healthful fatigue, a small
but very complete cabinet of shells, miniature casts
from the antique, moulded by himself in moments of
leisure, and a portfolio of exquisite pencil-drawings
by his own hand, all attested the elegance of his
tastes and the innocence of his pursuits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Mr. Allison’s daughters Ernest Melvyn appeared
in the light of a valued relative, a sort of “Cousin
Tom,” useful on all occasions and obtrusive on none,
universally liked, and allowed to come and go with
all the freedom of a family friend, less noticed when
present than missed when absent. But to the little
golden-haired Mary he was an object of far more
importance, and even when the flush of womanhood
began to brighten the cheek of the little maiden, and
her innocent bosom thrilled with those “impulses of
soul and sense,” which mark the first step beyond the
limit of girlish gayety, Ernest was still the friend, the
confidant of all her joys and sorrows. Exceedingly
sensitive in character, with feelings keenly alive to
every emotion, full of affection and gentleness, and
quick to receive impressions, Mary Allison was a
creature of impulse rather than judgment. The circle
which had long surrounded her sisters now opened to
admit her also. Two of Mr. Allison’s daughters
were on the verge of matrimony, while two still
remained free to win new lovers to their feet, when
Mary made her entrance into society. Conscious
that she possessed no small share of the beauty which
had made her sisters so attractive, vague dreams of
future triumphs and successes began to mingle with
her gentler feelings. The spirit which often leads
a beautiful woman into the mazes of coquetry, was
striving in the heart of the fair girl, and but for
the quiet counsels of Ernest, who was now her
mentor in the perilous days of womanhood, even as
he had been her playfellow in the sunny hours of
childhood, she might have become a vain and
frivolous votary of fashion. But there was something
in the calm reproach of Ernest’s thoughtful eye,
which restrained the wayward follies of the flattered
belle, and Mary felt, long ere she acknowledged even
to herself the truth, that, whatever might be the
charms of adulation, the approval of one noble heart
was worth them all. When lovers came around her,
Ernest gently withdrew from all apparent competition,
content to watch from afar, lest danger or deception
should touch the object of his hallowed interest.
Keeping always aloof from the throng of
admirers who now found their way habitually to a
house where such varied attractions were ever to be
met, Ernest seemed abstracted and indifferent. The
incense offered by the professed danglers, the attentions
of beaux, the heavy <span class='it'>bon-mots</span> of would-be witlings,
fell on his ear unheeded; but when one of
lofty mind and noble character, a man worthy of
respect and affection, when such an one offered his
homage at the shrine of youthful beauty, Ernest was
all eye, all ear, aye, and all heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was Ernest in love with Mary Allison? Who
can tell? surely he was too unpresuming, too calm,
too free from jealousy to be in love. Yet what meant
his eager watchfulness over her every look and
word, his keen perception of her every impulse, his
deep devotion to her every wish? It was most
strange, and yet might not a warm fraternal affection
for one who had taken the place of his dead sister in
his heart, account for all his feelings? Such was
Ernest’s belief, and if he deceived himself, his was
the punishment as well as the error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One after another, the beautiful daughters of Mr.
Allison were wedded, until only Mary, the lovely
Mary, whose very changefulness of temper formed
one of her brightest charms, alone was left. From
her sixteenth year Mary had received the homage of
flattery and affection. Some had wooed her for her
fortune, some for her gayety, some for her warm-heartedness,
but all had alike been unsuccessful.
When questioned as to her motives for this indiscriminate
coldness, she would only laugh, and toss back
her golden locks with a look of mischievous mirth
that seemed the index of a light and unfettered heart.
Utterly free from the coquetry which can deliberately
win hearts but to wound them, she yet loved admiration,
and could seldom resist the temptation of making
herself agreeable. Indeed she could scarcely avoid
making conquests, for her usual sweetness of manner
was sufficient of itself to attract all who came within
its influence. As Miss Edgeworth has beautifully
expressed it, “even from the benevolence of her
own disposition she derived the means of giving pain,
as the bee is said to draw the venom of its sting from
its own honey.” Too sensitive for frivolous coquetry,
Mary was in far more danger from those
sentimental flirtations which are so fascinating to
the romantic and the imaginative, and often so fatal
to the peace of those who indulge in them. Few
women—I mean warm-hearted, high-souled women—have
escaped the influence of these “opium
dreams of too much youth and reading,” as they are
contemptuously called by the worldly and the cold.
Few but have, at the early dawn of womanhood,
cherished a pure and passionless affection, which the
world may have sneered at as “Platonic,” and the
prudent may have censured as indiscreet, but which
was a source of infinite happiness while it endured,
and which, perhaps, by the very anguish of its dissolution,
afforded the best of all discipline for the
future trials of the heart. Yet, like all other exquisite
pleasures in this changing world, such joy is
only to be bought at the price of future pain. Rarely
does such an attachment terminate without suffering—rarely
does that passionless dream fade into the
splendors of a brighter reality—rarely does the
heart awake from its trance of sublimated feeling to
find loftier and sweeter impulses in actual life and
perfect love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From such perils, to which her romantic temper
would probably have exposed her, Mary Allison was
preserved by the watchfulness of Ernest. Indeed
their mutual regard seemed to possess much of the
character of such an affection as has just been described,
but without its dangers. He was her friend,
her counsellor, the guide of her wayward feelings;
but there was none of that high-wrought sensibility,
that fervent language which would be impassioned
were it not so pure, that ardor of feeling which
gives to such a friendship the semblance of love—but
of love <span class='it'>wingless</span>, and with bow unbent. Ernest
never ventured to be other than the friend, the
honored, trusted and humble friend. Not that he
was a servile, mean-spirited contemner of himself
because of his property—for he was in truth as high-souled,
lofty-minded, and proud-hearted a being as
ever wrestled with fortune—but gratitude had quickened
his perception of duty, and, in the echoes of his
own heart, he learned the nature of his own humility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary had attained her twenty-second year when
she received another offer of marriage from a gentleman
whose character and standing in society made
him a most eligible match. He was refused, but so
kindly and gently, that he resolved not to be repulsed.
He persevered in a course of delicate attentions
which even Mary’s fastidiousness could not reject,
and he demanded the consideration due to friendship
till he could make good his claims to a warmer interest.
He was certainly not distasteful to Mary,
and had she been called to choose one from among
her professed lovers, Charles Walton would probably
have been the object of her choice. But she was
conscious that she was capable of a much stronger
emotion than he had inspired, and a very slight examination
into her heart showed her one sealed
recess which she dared not venture to unlock.
Within that holy of holies, which every mortal
shrouds within his bosom, she knew that an image
was enshrined on which maiden pride forbade her to
look, and the fair girl turned away dismayed from
her self-imposed task. But her lover was patient
and persevering, and, after months of assiduous
wooing, he sought her father’s aid. Mr. Allison had
never interfered to control the inclinations of his
children. If the suitor was only a man of integrity
and honor, mere pecuniary disparity was never
allowed to influence his opinions, but, in this case,
he certainly was disposed to wish that Mary might
decide in Mr. Walton’s favor. He wished to retire
from business, and Walton was very competent to
supply his place in a concern which might still be
conducted for the benefit of the family, if Mary
would become the wife of the new partner. Actuated
by these motives he promised his influence to
the ardent lover; but the more he reflected upon his
task the more reluctant he felt to perform it. He
could not bear to influence the affections of his
favorite child, and yet he earnestly wished her to
think as he did. Like most men in a similar predicament,
he adopted a middle course, and quieted
his scruples by committing the trust to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, just at twilight, Mary was in a small
apartment communicating with the drawing-room,
when her father approached in close conversation
with Ernest Melvyn. They took a seat in the parlor,
and, as the door was ajar, Mary could not avoid
hearing her own name several times repeated. She
was about entering the room when she heard her
father say, “I wish, Ernest, you would use your influence
with Mary. I am sure she prefers Mr. Walton,
and it is only a woman’s whim which prevents
her acceptance of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure she is attached to Walton?” asked
Ernest, in a low and hurried tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I cannot be mistaken about it; she likes him
better than any lover she has ever had, for she confessed
as much to me yesterday. It is full time she
came to some decision, and I wish she would accept
him. He is exactly the kind of person whom I
should have selected for her, and I am sure he will
make her happy. She is greatly influenced by your
opinions, Ernest, and I really wish you would advise
her to marry Walton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary listened breathlessly for Ernest’s answer.
After a long pause she heard him say, “Certainly,
sir, if you wish it, I will do so.” Mary staid for
no more. Hurrying to her room, she flung herself on
the floor in an agony of excited feeling. The secret
of her heart was now revealed to her, and the anguish
which overwhelmed her proved how fondly
she had cherished the delusion. She now knew
what before she more than suspected; she no longer
doubted that her heart and happiness had long been
in the keeping of the modest and gentle Ernest. But
with this knowledge came the startling fact that
Ernest loved her not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could coldly promise his influence to give me
to another—me, whom he has cherished from childhood—me,
who have loved him from my very infancy!
Yes, his is but a brother’s love, and never
shall my nature be disgraced by the disclosure of an
unrequited passion. It shall be plucked away even
if entwined with the very fibres of my heart.” Such
were the reflections of the unhappy girl, as the violence
of her emotions subsided. Could she have
seen the bitter struggle in the breast of Ernest—could
she have divined the hidden agony of his spirit
when he controlled his voice to utter those cold words—could
she have known the sudden wretchedness
of that moment which first revealed to him the depth
and breadth of his own absorbing passion, she would
have decided differently. One word then would have
secured the happiness of both; but the word was <span class='it'>unspoken</span>,
and the destiny of both was sealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That very night Charles Walton renewed his suit
to Mary and <span class='it'>was accepted</span>—the next morning Mr.
Allison informed Ernest that his influence was no
longer necessary in the matter. The next week preparations
for the marriage were commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several days Ernest absented himself from
Mr. Allison’s house, but just as every body was beginning
to wonder what could ail him, he came, and
took his accustomed seat, as quiet and perhaps rather
more silent than was his wont. He looked pale and
care-worn, but his mother’s renewed paroxysm of
illness was sufficient to account for his appearance,
and though his lip quivered and his hand trembled
as he offered his congratulations to Mary, yet no one
could have dreamed that beneath his calm seeming
he concealed an immolated heart. Mary’s pride
rose to her aid when she beheld Ernest’s undisturbed
demeanor. She almost despised herself for the
weakness which made her shudder as with an ague,
when he offered his wishes for her future happiness;
and, resolutely closing her bosom against all such
emotions, she determined to perform the duties she
had undertaken with a firm and unyielding spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The increasing illness of the invalid, Mrs. Melvyn,
soon confined Ernest so closely to his home, during
his leisure hours, that he thus escaped the torture of
witnessing the arrangements for Mary’s marriage.
It was perhaps fortunate for both, since the tie between
them was now to be severed, that it should
be done thus gradually, and from a sense of duty to
others, rather than from selfish feelings. At times
Mary half suspected that Ernest loved her, but the
stern, self-sacrificing devotion of him who believed
that she had chosen wisely and well, destroyed the
fancy ere it became a hope. “She has fulfilled the
wishes of her father—she has found love and happiness,”
said Ernest to himself, “and not one shadow
from the cloud which impends over my fate shall
ever darken her path.” And with a courage far
more exalted than that which binds the martyr to
the faggot and the stake, did this noble-hearted being
crush his own heart within him, lest he should
mar the hopes of her whom he loved better than
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest did not see Mary wedded. On the very
night of her bridal his mother died, and, in the awful
stillness of the death-chamber, the voice of passion
was hushed into silence. It was not until his only
companion was laid in her humble grave, and the
quiet of exhaustion had gradually stolen over the
tortured feelings of the bereaved and heart-sick Ernest,
that he ventured to approach the dwelling of
Mr. Allison. Amid their festivities the family had not
been regardless of his sorrow, and many an act of
unobtrusive kindness had shown him that he was affectionately
remembered among them. But he had
learned some sad and solemn truths as he watched
beside his dying mother. The nothingness of human
cares, the vanity of human hopes, the fruitlessness
of human affections had been deeply impressed
upon his heart. His mother’s last lesson, imparted
in the peacefulness of her dying hour, came with
thrilling power to his bosom, and in the loneliness of
his deep grief he learned life’s hardest lesson—“<span class='it'>to
suffer and be still</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more trial yet awaited him. Not long after
his mother’s death, Mr. Allison took him aside and
offered him a partnership in his lucrative business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am old,” said the merchant, “and want to be
released from toil; Charles Walton is to be the principal
in our firm, and we wish to secure your future
services, as well as to reward a fidelity which has
never once failed in twenty years of duty. Indeed,
Mary insisted that her husband should accept no proposition
which did not include you. I require no
capital from you; the profits arising from your yearly
deposit in my hands have swelled your little fund to
some ten thousand dollars, which I am ready to pay
over to you before commencing our new arrangement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are kind—very kind, my dear sir,” was Ernest’s
reply, while tears filled his eyes, and his emotions
choked his utterance; “believe me, I am not
ungrateful, and while life and health remain I shall
ever be devoted to your service. But I cannot accept
your noble offer—let me still be your clerk—your
servant, if you will—I am no longer fitted for
the responsibilities of a partner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow, you are as healthy, active, and
industrious as ever you were; you are in the very
prime of life, and must not talk of want of fitness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spring of life is gone,” said Ernest, mournfully,
“I have no motive now for exertion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are dispirited, Ernest—the loss of your mother
has saddened and depressed you. Think over
my proposition in a calm and dispassionate manner,
and I am convinced you will not refuse it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest did think long and deeply on the subject,
but his decision was unalterable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes too late; my life is now an aimless one,
and riches might only tend to make it a useless one
also; there are none to share my fortunes, and why
should a solitary and isolated man heap up riches
when he knows not who shall gather them? it comes
too late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! how often has that thought paralized the
energies and stricken the heart of the patient sufferer.
Even he, who in the flush of manhood can
proudly exclaim, “<span class='it'>I bide my time</span>,” as if in defiance
of fortune’s frowns, is often heard, when all was
gained, to sigh mournfully in after life over the chilling
reflection, “<span class='it'>it comes too late!</span>"—too late for the
fulfilment of hope—too late for the attainment of
happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest Melvyn never rose above the station of
confidential clerk, but the respect and esteem of his
employers testified his integrity and usefulness. Mr.
Walton learned to regard him with as much friendship
as Mr. Allison, and it was not long before he
was as welcome a guest in Mary’s new home as he
had ever been in the scenes of her joyous childhood.
Whatever might have been her feelings towards
Ernest, his perfect self-possession and calm demeanor,
by convincing her that he had never loved her,
aided her in the subjugation of her own rebellious
heart. Her husband was kind, affectionate, and
good. She had always respected his talents and
esteemed his virtues, and now, as time wove the
new and strong ties of parental affection between
them, the quiet happiness of domestic life gradually
effaced the brightest tints of her youth’s romance.
It may be that a shadow rested long on her path—it
may be that the spectre of blighted love sometimes
stood beside the shrine of her household gods—but
Time, the true exorciser of all such ghosts, wrought
his work of kindness, slowly but surely, and Mary
became a cheerful, useful and happy woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest experienced the usual changes which come
upon a solitary man. He lived alone among his
books, and pictures, and shells, until they became
actually objects of tender interest to him. Regularly,
every afternoon, he visited Mr. Allison, and read
the newspapers for his benefactor, whose failing
sight rendered the perusal of his favorite journals a
task of some difficulty. This done, Ernest returned
to his home and passed the remainder of the evening
in study—aimless it is true, but still pleasing; or in a
dreamy and vague reverie so enticing to a reserved
and imaginative man. But on one certain evening
in each week, he always took his seat at Mrs. Walton’s
tea-table, and as regularly ensconced himself in
the chimney-corner as soon as tea was over. To the
isolated man this weekly visit, and those claspings of
the hand with which he was always greeted, were
as dear as the “memorable kiss” with which the
“apostle of passion” fed his wild idolatry; aye, full
as precious and far more pure was the joy thus
imparted than any refinement of infidel philosophy
and illicit love. Mary’s children climbed his knee,
even as Mary had done in her own glad infancy, and
loved him with all the fervent affection which had
once characterized her feelings. Like all old bachelors,
he became somewhat of a humorist, and, at
last, was voted by the dandies of the rising generation,
to be decidedly eccentric. But his kindliness
of heart, his firm integrity, and his purity and delicacy
of feeling never forsook him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the day of his death he never disclosed the
secret of his early love. When the frosts of three-score
winters had whitened his locks, the solitary
old man withdrew to his lonely room, and there,
amid those inanimate objects which had been his
solace through so many weary years, he yielded up
his gentle spirit to the God who gave it. He was
found one morning lying in the quiet sleep of death—his
arms crossed upon his breast, his bible on the
table at his bedside, and his features settled in such
sweet repose that none looked upon them without
feeling that Death had indeed dealt mercifully with
the righteous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His will was found in his cabinet, and Mary Walton
was made the sole heiress of his little fortune;
although no reason was assigned for this exclusive
preference. Perhaps the little casket which was
discovered in a secret recess of the same cabinet
disclosed somewhat of the truth to her conscious
heart. It contained a lock of golden hair, marked:
“<span class='it'>given me by Mary on her twelfth birthday</span>,”
together with a withered bouquet, which, from the
silken band around it, Mary remembered to have
given him the night preceding her betrothal, and a
penciled sketch in which she had no difficulty to
recognize her own girlish beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, does my tale seem tame and trite? it is
the history of a blighted heart; and if the secrets of
that strange world of mystery were more frequently
revealed, many such a tale of simple pathos would
enlist the sympathies of the glad and gay. The picture
of that self-forgetting being, subduing his love,
at first, from the very humility of true affection, and,
afterwards, crushing it within his heart lest its living
presence should mar the happiness of his beloved,
is to me one of ineffable tenderness. That he was
mistaken in his views of her happiness does not
destroy the beauty of his self-devotion; and what
shall we say of the moral courage which could relinquish
all claims to <span class='it'>posthumous</span> sympathy, by bearing
his secret to the grave, lest a shadow from the past
should fall upon her present peacefulness?</p>

<p class='line0'>He shall bring back, but brighter, broader still,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR A PHYSICIAN EXTRAORDINARY.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “A NEW HOME,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor R—— sat alone in his study when a lady
was announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Waldorf, sir,” and the doctor laid down his
pen and received his visiter very cordially. She
was the wife of a rich German merchant, and a distant
cousin of his own; a handsome woman of about
five and thirty, with sufficient repose of manner, but
too spirited an eye to pass for a mere fashionable
machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to you, doctor, instead of sending
for you,” began the lady, “because I do not wish
Mr. Waldorf to know I have thought it necessary to
consult you. He is so easily alarmed, that if he knew
you had prescribed for me he would watch me so
closely and insist so much upon my observance of
your directions to the very letter, that I should have
no peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor smiled, as if he thought Mr. Waldorf
would not be so far wrong as his lady might suppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it, my dear madam?” he said, taking
Mrs. Waldorf’s hand and giving a look of professional
scrutiny to her face. “You look well, though
there is a slight flaccidity about the eyes, and not
quite so ruddy a nether lip as one might wish to see.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! a thousand things, doctor; my health is
miserable—at least I sometimes think so; I have
pains in the right side—and such flutterings at my
heart—and such lassitude—and such headaches—and
sleep so miserably—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are your pains very severe? are they of a
heavy, dull kind, or sharp and darting? and how
often do you experience them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not very constant—no, not constant,
certainly, nor very severe—but, doctor, they fill me
with apprehensions of future evil. It is not present
suffering of which I complain, so much as a fear of
worse to come. I dread lest disease should make
such progress, unnoticed, that it will be vain to attempt
a cure.” And Mrs. Waldorf’s eyes filled with
tears at the very thought of her troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wise to take it in time,” said Doctor
R⁠——. “But tell me more of these symptoms. At
what time of the day do you generally feel most
indisposed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I can scarcely say. When I wake in the
morning, I am always very miserable. My head is
full of dull pain, especially about the eyes. My lips
are parched; I find it a great exertion to dress
myself, and never have the slightest appetite for
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! indeed!” mused the doctor, “you breakfast
as soon as you arise, I presume. At what hour do
you retire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We make it a rule to be in bed by twelve, unless
we happen to be engaged out, which is but seldom.
Waldorf detests parties and late hours. We spend
our evenings with music or books, very quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At what hour do you sup?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have nothing like a regular supper, but for
mere sociality’s sake we have a tray brought up
about ten. I take nothing beyond a bit of chicken or
a few oysters, or a slice of cake, and sometimes only
a cracker and a glass of wine. You look as if you
thought even this were better omitted; but I should
scarcely know how to cut off one of my husband’s
few social pleasures. He would touch nothing if I
did not partake with him. He thinks as ill of suppers
as you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon—I interrupted your detail of
symptoms to ask these questions as to the evening.
You say you have no appetite for breakfast—how
long do these feelings of languor and exhaustion
continue to trouble you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I generally feel better after a cup of coffee;
and after practicing at the harp or the piano-forte for
an hour or two, or sometimes three when I have
new music, I generally drive out, and perhaps shop
a little, or at any rate take a turn into the country
for the air, and usually return somewhat refreshed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you take your airings alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—perforce, almost. There are none of my
intimate friends who can go with me. They drive
out regularly, and take children with them, or they
have other objects; and one cannot ask a mere
acquaintance. So I go alone, which is not very
exhilarating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your own children are not at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—if they were, I should need no other company
for the carriage. The society of young people
is pleasant to me, but Adelaide is at Madame ——’s
and Ernest is with a German clergyman, a friend of
his father’s. I fancy my rides would be of much
greater service to me if I had a pleasant companion
or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly—and I know a lady and her daughter
to whom a regular morning airing with such
society as that of Mrs. Waldorf would be the very
breath of life! What a pity that etiquette comes in
the way of so many good things! But go on, I beg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Etiquette! say not another word, doctor—who
and where are these friends or patients of yours?
I should be happy if I could offer any service. I
will call with you on them this very day if you like,
and invite them to ride with me daily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you a thousand times, my dear madam,”
said Doctor R——, “it is what I could not venture
to ask. Yet I am not afraid you will not find my
friends at least tolerably agreeable—but will you
proceed with the account you were giving me of
your daily habits—you dine at four, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is our hour, but Mr. Waldorf is often
detained until five, and I never dine without him.
For my own part I should not care if dinner were
stricken from the day. I lunch about one, and with
tolerable appetite, and I never wish to eat again
until supper time. We take tea, however, at seven,
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Green tea, I presume—do you take it strong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! not very, if I take it <span class='it'>too</span> strong, I do not
sleep at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sleep but indifferently, you tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, generally; and wake many times in the
night; sometimes in the horrors, so that I am full of
undefinable fears, and dare not open my eyes lest
the objects in the room should assume terrific
shapes. The very shades cast by the night-lamp
have power at such times to appal me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s professional inquiries extended to a
still greater length, but he had guessed Mrs. Waldorf’s
complaint before he arrived at this point in the
list. He had found solitude, inactivity, late hours,
suppers, coffee, green tea, music and books—with
not one counterbalancing item of that labor—effort—sacrifice—which
has been affixed as the unchanging
price of health and spirits. Mrs. Waldorf was one
of the hundreds if not thousands of ladies in our land
who walk through the world without ever discovering
the secret of life. She had abundant wealth
and a most indulgent husband, with all that this
world can offer in point of comfort, and she imagined
that health alone was wanting to complete
her happiness. Passive happiness! what a dream!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor R—— was at the head of his profession,
and he had some medicines at his command which
are not known at the hospitals. He thought he could
cure Mrs. Waldorf, but he hinted that he feared he
should find her but a poor patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not wish Mr. Waldorf to know you
are under my care lest he should object to your
neglecting my remedies⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed doctor, I shall be very faithful! Try
me! You cannot prescribe anything too difficult.
Shall I travel to the Pyramids barefoot, and live on
bread and water all the way? I am only afraid
Waldorf should insist upon my taking odious drugs,
and—You know cautions meeting one at every turn
are so tiresome!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are willing to undertake any remedy
which is not at all disagreeable, and which may be
used or omitted <span class='it'>à discretion</span>⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—indeed you mistake me. I only beg that
it may not be <span class='it'>too</span> unpleasant. I will do just as you
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Waldorf now had a fine color, and her eyes
sparkled as of old. She had every confidence in the
skill of Dr. R——, and the effort of recalling and
recounting her symptoms had given an impetus to
her thoughts and a quicker current to her blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor apologized. He had an appointment
and his hour had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But before I leave you thus unceremoniously,”
he said, “it strikes me that there is a root in my
garden which might be of essential service to you, to
begin with at least. You know I have a little spot
in which I cultivate a few rare botanical specimens.
Might I venture to ask you to search for the root I
speak of? It is in that little square compartment in
the corner, which appears nearly vacant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, certainly—but had I not better call John, as
your own man is going away with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John! Bless my soul, my dear Madam, there is
not a John in the world that I would trust in my
sanctum! No hand but mine, and that of a gardener
whom I employ occasionally under my own direction,
ever intrudes among my pets. Let me entreat you,
since I have not another moment to spare, to take
this little trowel and search with your own hands
until you discover an oblong white root like this—”
opening a book of botanical plates and exhibiting
something that looked very much like a Jerusalem
artichoke—“Take that and have it washed and
grated into a gill of Port, of which try ten drops in a
little water three times a day. I will see you again
very soon—but now I must run away—” and Doctor
R⁠—— departed, leaving Mrs. Waldorf in a musing
mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cast a look at the garden, which lay just beneath
the window, full of flowers; then at the trowel—a
strange implement in her hand. She thought
Doctor R—— very odd, certainly, but she resolved
to follow his directions implicitly. She went down
stairs and was soon digging very zealously. Her
glove was split by the first effort, of course; for a
fashionably fitted glove admits not the free exercise
of the muscles—but all was of no avail. Every
corner of the little square was disturbed, but no talisman
appeared. Weary at length of her new employment,
Mrs. Waldorf gave up in despair, and sat
down in a little arbor which offered its shade invitingly
near her. Here she sank into a pleasant
reverie, as one can scarcely help doing in a garden
full of sweet flowers, and so pleasant was the sense
of repose after labor, that she thought not of the lapse
of time until she was startled by the voice of Doctor
R——, returned from his visit and exceedingly surprised
to find her still trowel in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear Madam,” he exclaimed, “you are
forgetting your wish that Mr. Waldorf should not
discover your visit to me! If he walks much in
town he has had ample opportunity to observe his
carriage at my door these two hours. You must
learn to carry on clandestine affairs better than this!
Have you the medicine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Waldorf laughed and related her ill success,
which the doctor very much regretted, although he
did not offer to assist in the search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are feeling tolerably well just now, I think,”
he said; “your color is better than when you came
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes! much better just now! But how charming
your garden is! I do not wonder that you make
a pet of it. We too have a few square inches of
garden, but it gives me but little pleasure, because I
have never done any thing to it myself. I think I
shall get a trowel of my own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You delight me! You have only to cultivate and
bring to perfection a single bed of carnations, to become
as great an enthusiast as myself. But it must
be done by your own hands—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly; but now I must be gone. To-morrow
I will hold myself in readiness to call on
your friends at any hour you will appoint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say you to eleven? Would that be too
barbarous? The air is worth a good deal more at
eleven than at one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At seven, if you like! Do not imagine me so
very a slave to absurd fashions! I am determined
you shall own me a reasonable woman yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Waldorf called from the carriage window—“You’ll
not forget to send the medicine, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not! you shall have it at seven this
evening, and I trust you will take it with exact regularity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not fear me,” she said, and the doctor made
his bow of adieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The medicine came at seven, with a sediment
which looked not a little like grated potato, and without
the slightest disagreeable taste. Accompanying
directions required the disuse, for the present, of
coffee and green tea; and recommended to Mrs.
Waldorf a daily walk and a very early bed-hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady took her ten drops at nine, and felt so
much better that she could not help telling her husband
all about her visit to Doctor R⁠——.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning proved cloudy, and Mrs. Waldorf
felt rather languid, but, after her dose, found an
improved appetite for breakfast. She sat down to
her music, but looked frequently at the clouds and at
her watch, thinking of her appointment. When the
hour arrived the envious skies poured down such
showers as will damp any body’s ardor. The drive
must be given up for that day, and it passed as usual,
with only the interlude of the magic drops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was as bad, and the day after not a
great deal better. Mrs. Waldorf’s pains and palpitations
almost discouraged her. She was quite sure
she had a liver complaint. But on the fourth morning
the sun rose gloriously, and the face of nature,
clean washed, shone with renewed beauty. At
eleven the carriage and the lady were at Doctor
R⁠——’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you courage to see an invalid—a sad sufferer?”
said the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, certainly! I am an invalid myself, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my dear lady, my invalid wears a different
aspect! Yet I hope she is going to recover, and I
shall trust to your humanity if the scene prove a sad
one. Sickness of the mind was, I think, the origin
of the evil, but it has almost overpowered the frail
body. This young lady and her mother have been
giving lessons in music and in Italian, and have had
but slender success in the whirl of competition. As
nearly as I can discover, they came to this country
hoping to find reverse of fortune easier to bear
among strangers; and their course was determined
hitherward in consequence of earlier family troubles
which drove a son of Madame Vamiglia to America.
He was a liberal, and both displeased his father and
put himself in danger from government, by some unsuccessful
attempt at home. The father is since
dead, and the old lady and her daughter, left in
poverty and loneliness, determined on following the
young man to the new world. But here we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they stopped before a small house in a back
street. Mrs. Waldorf was shown into a very humble
parlor, while the doctor went to prepare his patient.
He returned presently with Madame Vamiglia, a
well-bred woman past middle age. She expressed
her grateful sense of Mrs. Waldorf’s kindness, but
their communication was rather pantomimical, for
the lady found her song-Italian of little service, and
the signora had not much conversational English.
However, with some French, and occasional aid
from Doctor R——, their acquaintance was somewhat
ripened before they went to the bedside of the
sufferer. Mrs. Waldorf turned pale, and felt ready
to faint, at the sight which presented itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a low, narrow couch in the centre of
the room, scarce larger than an infant’s crib, and on
it lay what seemed a mere remnant of mortality.
Large dark eyes, full of a sort of preternatural light,
alone spoke of life and motion. The figure had been
always extremely small, and was now wasted till it
scarce lifted the light covering of the mattress.
Madame Vamiglia went forward and spoke in a low
tone to her daughter, and Mrs. Waldorf was glad to
sink into the chair set for her by Doctor R⁠——.
The ghastly appearance of the poor girl had quite
<span class='it'>unwomaned</span> her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother introduced her guest to her daughter,
who could only look an acknowledgment; and then
asked the doctor if he thought it possible that Ippolita
could bear the motion of a carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She seems weaker to-day,” he replied; “very
weak indeed. Yet, if Mrs. Waldorf will allow the
mattress to be put in, I think we may venture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vamiglia seemed full of anxiety lest the
experiment should prove too much for the flickering
remnant of life; but, after much preparation, John
was called, and the poor sufferer transferred, mattress
and all, to the back seat. Mrs. Waldorf and
her mother took the front, and in this way they drove
slowly out towards the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the poor little signorina seemed exhausted
almost unto death, and her mother watched her with
the most agonized solicitude; but after awhile she
became accustomed to the gentle motion, and seemed
revived by the fresh air. As the road wound through
a green lane shaded with old trees, Ippolita looked
about her with animation, and made a sign of
pleasure with her wasted hand. Tears started to
her mother’s eyes, and she looked to Mrs. Waldorf
for sympathy, and not in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the invalid murmured, “Assia!” and
they turned about. When they reached the lodging-house,
Ippolita was in a quiet sleep, and they carried
her back to her own room almost undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow at eleven!” whispered Mrs. Waldorf,
at parting. Madame Vamiglia pressed her
hand, but could not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need not describe the morning rides which succeeded
this auspicious commencement. We need
not trace, step by step, the slow amendment of the
young Italian, nor attempt to express, by words, the
gratitude of both mother and daughter. <span class='it'>They</span> felt
words to be totally inadequate. We may mention,
however, the rapid improvement of Mrs. Waldorf’s
health and spirits, which must of course be ascribed
to that excellent medicine of Doctor R⁠——’s. This
enabled that lady to study Italian most strenuously,
both at home and by familiar lessons from Madame
Vamiglia and her daughter, during their prolonged
excursions. This pursuit was never found to increase
the palpitations, and seemed also a specific
against headache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Ippolita had so far recovered as to be independent
of the daily airing, Mrs. Waldorf picked
up a new object of interest. We say picked up, for
it was a road-side acquaintance, and, as Mrs. Waldorf
has since observed, one which she never would
have made if she had been reading during her ride, as
was her custom formerly. She had, every morning
for some time, observed a poor woman drawing a
basket-wagon of curious construction, in which lay
a child much larger than is usually found in such
vehicles. The child was pretty, and tastefully,
though plainly, drest; but the whole establishment
bespoke any thing but abundant means, so that Mrs.
Waldorf was puzzled to make out the character of
the group. The woman had not the air of a servant,
and yet the child did not look as if it could be her
child. In short, after seeing the same thing a dozen
times, Mrs. Waldorf’s curiosity was a good deal
excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not, however, venture to make any inquiries
until it so chanced that, in the very green
lane we have spoken of—the favorite resort of the
grateful Ippolita—they found the poor woman, with
the child fainting in her arms. Grief and anxiety
were painted on her honest face, and she was so absorbed
in her efforts for the recovery of the child
that she scarcely answered Mrs. Waldorf’s sympathizing
inquiries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh don’t trouble yourself, ma’am! It is nothing
new! She’s this way very often. It’s the hoopin’-cough,
ma’am; and I’m afeard it’ll be the death of
her, poor lamb! in spite of all we can do!” And
she tossed the child in the air, and fanned its face till
the breath returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it your own?” asked Mrs. Waldorf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No indeed, ma’am! mine are other guess lookin’
children, thank God! This dear babe’s mother is a
delicate young lady that lives neighbor to me, as
has a sick husband that she can’t leave. I’m a
washerwoman, ma’am, if you please, and I have to
go quite away down town every day almost, and so
I take this poor thing in my basket—it’s large enough,
you see—and so gives her a turn in the open air,
’cause the doctor says it’s the open air, if any thing,
that’ll do her good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very good,” said Mrs. Waldorf, who
had listened in a kind of reverie, her thoughts reverting
to her lonely rides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, ma’am! it’s far from good I am! The
Lord knows that! But a little bit of neighborly
kindness like that, is what the poor often does for
one another, <span class='it'>and don’t think any thing of it, neither</span>!
To be sure this babe’s mother isn’t the likes of me,
ma’am, but she’s far worse off than she has been.
Her husband is what they call an accountant—a kind
of clerk, like; and he can’t get no employ, and I
think it’s breakin’ his heart pretty fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mrs. Waldorf fairly burst into tears. “Tell
me where you live,” she said, “and say nothing to
this lady you speak of, but come to me to-morrow,
will you?” and she put a card into the poor woman’s
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely I will, ma’am,” said the washerwoman,
“and it’s a kind heart you have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Waldorf rode home with her heart and head
full. “How could I ever content myself with giving
<span class='it'>money</span>,” she said to herself, “when there is so much
to be <span class='it'>done</span>!”</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you find yourself, this morning, my dear
madam?” said Doctor R⁠——, shortly after this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite well, thank you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! no more lassitude! no more headaches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the sort, I assure you! I never felt
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did your symptoms abate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can scarcely tell; I have been too much occupied
of late, to think of symptoms. I am so much
interested in the study of Italian that I am going to
ask Madame Vamiglia and her daughter to come to
us for awhile, and we shall have Adelaide at home
to take advantage of so good an opportunity for
learning to converse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your ardor in searching out the distressed
has been the means of restoring the son to the
mother! How happy you must be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a happiness which I owe to you! and
Mr. Waldorf is going to employ Mr. Vamiglia, who
understands and writes half a dozen different languages,
and will be invaluable to him. But first the
family are to go to the sea-shore for a month, to
recruit; and I imagine they will need a good deal
of preparation—so that I have really no time to
be ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have given up the going to the
Pyramids?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my dear sir! I must thank you for showing
me better sources of interest and excitement. I
believe it must have been a little <span class='it'>ruse</span> on your part—say!
was not that famous medicine of yours only a
trick—an <span class='it'>inganno felice</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A trick! Oh! excuse me! ‘Call it by some
better name!’ I beseech you,” said the doctor laughing,
“it was a most valuable medicine! Indeed the
whole Materia Medica would be often powerless
without the <span class='it'>placebo</span>! But I confess I could not
think of sending you to the Pyramids, when there
are not only pyramids but mountains of sorrow and
suffering at home, which shun the eye of common
charity, but which must be surmounted by just such

<p class='line0'>We parted at the midnight hour,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We parted <span class='it'>then</span> as lovers part.</p>
<p class='line0'>The stars which pierced that trellis’d bower,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;They saw me press her to my heart!</p>
<p class='line0'>I left her with no fear—no doubt!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I left with her my hopes—my all⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I left her then,—oh! God!—without</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A dream of what would soon befall.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I went to toil—far from her sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Far from her blessed voice away⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>But still she haunted me by night,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Still murmured in my ears by day.</p>
<p class='line0'>The hours flew by in dreams of her,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Those hours which claimed far other care,</p>
<p class='line0'>I wasted them—fond worshiper⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In dreams, whose waking was despair!</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A month—no, not a month,—by Heaven!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Had fled since she was pledged to me⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Since <span class='it'>I</span> love’s parting kiss had given</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To seal <span class='it'>her</span> vows of constancy!</p>
<p class='line0'>The very moon was not yet old,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Whose crescent beam our loves had lighted⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet ere those few short weeks were told,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She had forgot the faith she plighted!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I heard her lips that faith forswear⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And, while those lips revealed the tale,</p>
<p class='line0'>My very soul it blushed that e’er</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It could have loved a thing so frail!</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet scorn—it was not scorn that stung⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Twas pity—horror—grief, that moved me⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I felt the wrong—the shameless wrong,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But spared the heart that once had loved me!</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yes, faithless, false, as now I found it,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When all its shielding worth was flown.</p>
<p class='line0'>What though I could believe no more</p>

<p class='line0'>Yet still when all Love’s faith was o’er,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The subtle chain around me cast,</p>

<p class='line0'>Could they betray my mind once more,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Those pleading looks? yes! even then,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ay! strangely, as at first we met⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There did, by Heaven! around her hover</p>
<p class='line0'>Such light of warmth and truth, that yet</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I, at the last, was still her lover!</p>
<p class='line0'>And when I saw her brow o’ercast⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Saw tears from those soft eyelids melt,</p>
<p class='line0'>I recked not, cared not for the past,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But there, adoring, would have knelt!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>That moment to her lip and eye</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There came that calm and loveless air,</p>

<p class='pindent'>If man in all ranks is liable to be thus betrayed by
appearances, the king is peculiarly exposed to this
danger. Nearly all the beautiful forms around him
are but the disguises of treachery and selfishness.
He is at once master, dupe and victim. All the
wisdom and philosophy he can learn from the experience
of others, or from his own, are feeble protection
against the profound and subtle duplicity which
pervades the air he breathes and every moment of
his contact with his fellow creatures. A king is as
much confined within a certain circle of information
and action as the salamander girt with fire. I have
heard of the most extraordinary events of public notoriety
being concealed from royal knowledge in a
manner almost passing credit. In the following
passage see how kings are duped:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know whether we may safely at all times
ascribe the remarkable reflection of facts upon each
other in the works of Shakspeare to the deliberate
intention of the poet, or whether we may suppose
them in some degree accidental. I am inclined to
think, however, that it belongs to the high order of
genius with which he was invested to exercise a
power which, in its sphere, and with reverence be
it spoken, is not without something of <span class='it'>omnipresence</span>.
Here the king has just rid himself of one traitor of
the blackest dye, whose guilt is placed beyond doubt,
as it is almost beyond parallel, by his open and
nearly successful treason in the late battle, and by
his own confession. The betrayed sovereign then,
just barely escaped from the ruinous treachery of one
villain—yet one in whom he had built “an absolute
trust”—after all the experience which we may suppose
him to have acquired, for he is an old man,
turns to another gentleman in whom also he builds
“an absolute trust,” and, with a wise and just reflection
scarcely ceased sounding from his lips—(a reflection

<p class='pindent'>Certainly were I a king I should either not read
Macbeth, or the reading of it would often disturb my
peace and check the flow of my feelings and opinions.
Hence royalty <span class='it'>is</span>, and is obliged to be, closed
in itself—surrounded by cold forms and highly artificial
ceremonies, removed from the action of the
common, simple and sweet impulses and emotions
of life—removed from friendship—love—ordinary
social society—from the pleasures of confidence and
independence—from visits and acquaintance-making,
and many others which the private subject enjoys
and derives as much unconscious pleasure from as
from the air and sun. If I were a king I should
never trust a human being. I should feel ever as if I
were led along blindfold to suit purposes, of the existence
of which I could not be aware—to injure
people whom perhaps, if I knew them, I should
desire to protect—and to aid others, who, were their
real natures open to my inspection, I might perhaps
be the first to punish. I should shrink from offers of
service lest, even in them who had most served me,
might lurk a Macbeth to defend, honor and ruin me.
The master of a household finds it impossible to follow
with his eye or his mind the daily course of his
own domestics. Watch them as he may they are
sure of continually returning opportunities to deceive
and cheat him. Neglect and fraud and duplicity,
although on a minute scale, are in perpetual operation,
the prevention of which, even when detected,
baffles his utmost address. There are few families
in the world—at least in the old European metropolises—where
a certain description of dishonesty is
not almost openly practiced and even consciously
permitted. I have heard an anecdote of a master
who made his servant an offer to add twenty pounds
a year to his annual wages on condition of his swearing
not to cheat him out of a cent. The valet, after
calculating half an hour, declined the proposition.
In humanity, the great central pervading principle is
<span class='it'>selfishness</span>. It exists in <span class='it'>every bosom</span>, as attraction
exists in every object. In some it is modified, mastered
and even beautified by warmth of heart, sincerity
of religion and clearness of understanding. In
others it is augmented beyond its natural proportions,
by the peculiar temperament and the want of moral
and intellectual cultivation. In the slender opportunities
I have had of observing the world I have been
particularly and painfully struck with the humiliating
truth that <span class='it'>selfishness</span>—deepening, from the mere instinct
of preservation, into various shades of meanness,
dishonesty and crime, is the <span class='it'>great passion</span>
of the world. Men are often intellectually and
politically great notwithstanding it and perhaps in
consequence of it, but no one is morally great without
escaping from its earth-attracting and inglorious
influence. This passion increases in the bosom of
the bad, in proportion to the greatness of the object.
In the precincts of a court, (although it is a vulgar
error to suppose virtue and disinterestedness may
not exist there also,) it becomes more condensed—more
profound, more plausibly disguised, but more
quietly and universally pervading than elsewhere.
In a royal circle nearly every other feeling is extinct,
and the pressure for favor and the sacrifice of minor
(and how much more graceful and noble) considerations
at the shrine of courtly or fashionable ambition
are, to the observing eye, very visible beneath the glittering
surface of society. The king <span class='it'>knows</span> no body.
He has no opportunity of seeing, hearing or judging.
The good and the bad address him alike in the language
of homage and adulation, and he comes at
last to lose his natural sympathies with the human
race—to regard them as inferiors—machines, cattle.
To him they are so. Before him they are contemptible.
They too often lay aside in his presence, and
in proportion as they approach his throne, their
claims to respect and their habits of candor, dignity
and goodness, and a crowd of people are rarely presented
to a king without their overvaluing some
things and undervaluing others most lamentably.
At the same time the sovereign himself, however
good and great he may be, cannot well be considered
without a certain degree of regret and commiseration,
when one reflects that the hypocrisy always
more or less existing in polite society is redoubled
in his presence, and that he has always lived and is
destined ever to continue to live in a mist. The unveiled
face of human nature he is doomed never to
see. He is continually trusting things which nearly
concern him to men of whom he knows literally
nothing. Then Duncan with his kingly credulity
hears his murderer declare⁠—</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It is worthy of remark here, and is another instance
of the exhaustless room there is in these plays for the
observation of ages, that while Macbeth, who is ready
crouched like a ferocious leopard to leap upon his
prey, is warm and ardent in his expressions of loyalty
and submission, Banquo, who is that somewhat
rare character a really <span class='it'>honest man</span>, says but very few
words to his sovereign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have always been accustomed to think that the
murder scene of Macbeth involved one of those violations
of probability so often found in works of fiction.
It seemed that the murder, which is committed
as soon as the guests in the castle are asleep, could
not very well be interrupted by the knocking of Macduff
entering in the morning to awake the king. This
objection, like most of those advanced against the inspired
bard, disappears upon a closer examination and
the supposed fault turns out to be an exquisite beauty.
Inverness is in a very northern latitude, and in the
summer (the season in which the crime is perpetrated)
the day dawns almost as soon as the night falls.
I have never been more struck with the beauty of
nature than while watching the coming on and passing
away of one of these northern summer nights.
The change is so brief and lovely—the sun sets so
lingeringly and leaves behind him such a heaven of
mild and scarcely fading glory, the stars come forth
so sparklingly and in such small numbers, and the
pale silver opening of day rises in the east so soon
after the world has fallen under the shadowy silence
of the night, that, to one who has only seen the nights
of lower latitudes and who associates ten or twelve
hours of darkness with every revolution of the globe,
it appears almost the luminous change of some
heavenlier planet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Macbeth’s deed is committed in this season,
we learn from the scene already noticed of the previous
day when the king enters the castle and remarks,
for the last time, the soothing effect of the
summer air upon his senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not feel sure that all these corresponding
beauties and proprieties were intended by Shakspeare,
and we have all often heard it questioned
whether he himself would not be surprised to see
the exquisite things discovered in his works. It is
possible; but I do not think that alters his merit,
since the beauties really exist. In his advances into
the story he keeps everywhere nature and truth in
view, and hence consequences and effects of that
wonderful proportion and perfection may be visible
to the reader not thought of in detail by the
writer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is certain that, in the instance above alluded to,
had the fatal incident occurred in the <span class='it'>winter</span>, and had
the murderers thus been interrupted almost in the act
by the incoming of Macduff and the commencement
of the routine of the subsequent day, there would
have been an inconsistency which does not now
exist.</p>

<div><h1><a id='nig'></a>A NIGHT AT HADDON HALL.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “LETTERS FROM ANCIENT CASTLES.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following extraordinary circumstance, which
occurred to a young lady whilst on a visit at the
house of an English nobleman of the highest rank,
is, I believe, unparalleled for acute mental anguish
and excitement, during the hours of its continuance. It
was related to us by the descendant of a person who
resided in the Hall during its occurrence, and I have
every reason to believe it to be substantially true, in
all its main features. In order to make it more intelligible,
and give it that effect to which it seems
well entitled, a short description of the place may
perhaps be allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haddon Hall, in the county of Derby, is situated
in the upper or mountainous part of the county,
called, from that circumstance, the High Peak.
The manor of Haddon, at the time of the Norman
invasion, in the year 1066, was given by the conqueror
to William Peverel, his natural son, whose
descendants were named Avenel, and in them it
remained till towards the close of the twelfth century,
when it changed possessors by the union of Avicia
Avenel with Sir Richard de Vernon, whose heirs held
it for three centuries, at which time it became the
properly of the noble family who now retain it, by the
marriage of Dorothy, daughter of Sir George Vernon,
with Sir John Manners, second son of the Earl of
Rutland, in 1565, very nearly three hundred years
ago. Sir George Vernon had the proud title of King
of the Peak conferred upon him by courtesy, in consequence
of his splendid hospitality, and immense
number of servants and retainers, during the reign of
King Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray towers of ancient Haddon are beautifully
situated, on a rocky eminence, in the valley of the
Derbyshire Wye, one of the many lovely streams in
that picturesque county. It is surrounded by a park,
abounding with ancient oaks of gigantic size, and a
terrace garden of the greatest beauty. This noble
old place, although long since abandoned by the
family of the Duke of Rutland, for the more modern
and magnificent Palace of Belvoir, in Lincolnshire, is
still kept in perfect order and repair, and is probably
the most perfect specimen of a baronial residence
extant in England. The tapestries, teeming with
subjects from holy writ and heathen mythology, still
adorn the walls, covering the wainscotings and
doors; and any one wishing to exemplify the scenery
of Shakspeare, where Hamlet slays Polonius behind
the arras, has only to visit Haddon and find a
true original of that from which the immortal poet
painted his terrific scene. The antique heir-looms
of the Vernons and Rutlands are all in place
as they stood centuries ago. The lofty state-bed,
with its gorgeous but faded hangings, worked by the
fair hands of lady Katherine De Roos, wife of Sir
George Manners, is a splendid specimen of the
period. The suits of ancient armor, in which many
a gallant knight did battle during the wars of the
rival roses, are hanging on their original pegs in
the armory under the long gallery. The chapel, in
the crypt of the castle, the most ancient part of it,
exhibits huge pillars coeval with the times of the
Saxons, whilst the walnut tree pulpit and pews are
richly carved with the symbols of the catholic faith.
The silver dogs, or and<span class='it'>irons</span>, are yet on the ample
hearths of the long gallery, and, at the upper end of
the banqueting hall, on the <span class='it'>dais</span>, or elevated part of
the floor, still stands, firm as a rock, the huge long
oak table on which, heretofore, the lord of the mansion
feasted his friends and tenants. Over one side
of this hall is the music gallery, where the minstrels
of yore played and sang, its antique and curious
front highly adorned with gothic carving. Against the
door post of the banqueting hall is the <span class='it'>hand bolt</span>—used
in the old times as a mode of punishing the
domestics who had been guilty of irregularities. It
consists of an iron ring, by which the wrist of the
offender can be locked in, and secured, as high as he
can reach, above his head; and the unlucky culprit
who refused to take off his horn of liquor in turn, or
committed any petty offence against the laws of conviviality,
had the alternative presented to him of
quaffing a beaker of salt and water, or having his
arm bolted in, whilst a quantity of cold spring water
was poured down the upraised sleeve of his doublet,
until it ran over the tops of his boots. The iron
cresset is yet fixed on the loftiest pinnacle of the
watch-tower, wherein the beacon fires blazed during
alarms in the civil wars. All, all are there; and it is
impossible to walk through the mazes of such a perfect,
such a glorious specimen of the olden time,
without an innate, reverential, awful feeling, as if
you had been born and had lived during those antique
days, and were removed backward in the world
many hundreds of years. You <span class='it'>feel</span> as if you were
become part and parcel of the ancient things which
at every turn meet your wondering eye. Any
stranger, used to a town life, might well be excused,
on entering Haddon, for entertaining thoughts and
feelings of a grave and sombre cast, when every
article recalls the memory of those who, for so many
ages, have departed for “that undiscovered country
from whose bourne no traveler returns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now very many years ago, during the life of
one of the dukes of Rutland, who was facetiously
named “John of the Hill,” from his perpetual residence
on the moors and ardor in the chase, that a
large party had assembled at Haddon to enjoy the
recreation of autumnal sports. Among the guests
was a young lady named Chamberlain, of good birth
but impoverished fortune, owing to lamentable reverses
in her family. She was the companion of a
lady of high rank, and as such, of course, possessed
of superior accomplishments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Chamberlain was mistress of extraordinary
acquirements, added to an energy of mind and force
of character seldom to be found in a beautiful girl
of eighteen. She, with the Countess of Carlisle,
whose protégé she was, arrived at the Hall on the
evening previous to the night of the terrifying scenes
about to be related.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house being full of company, the room which
the groom of the chambers appropriated to Miss
Chamberlain was that particular one still shown at
the eastern angle of the inner, or rather upper
quadrangle, overlooking the terrace garden. That
particular room had not been occupied for many
months, and, as it was then October, Miss Chamberlain
found when she retired a good wood fire blazing
on the hearth. She had found in the library the
earliest known edition of the immortal Dante, and,
being well versed in its language, she carried the
volume to her room. Having carefully bolted the
door, before letting fall the arras which covered it,
she sat long reading the divine work. In such a
place, at such an hour, there is no doubt that the
terrific pictures presented to the imagination by the
power of such an author as Dante, had much effect
in imbuing her mind with a greater feeling of awe
for what was to follow. Having closed the volume,
made her toilet, and imprisoned the last ringlet,
the innocent girl turned to the antique mirror to
take a last smiling glance at those charms which
had that evening called forth many a delicate compliment
from the young and gallant Marquis of Granby,
the Duke’s son. She then, with profound piety,
recommended herself to the Divine protection,
extinguished her lamp, and, by the light of the still
clear fire, retired to the farther side of the great
o’ercanopied bed. She lay long awake, recalling
the incidents of the day, and ruminating on the
fearful drama she had been perusing. Sleep at
length assumed his dominion over her, and the last
sounds of the numerous domestics about the hall had
long died away, ere she awoke from her first slumber,
during which she had dreamed a fearful dream.
The moon, which was then in its last quarter, had
just risen, and shed a faint pale light through the
mullions of the gothic window, the glass whereof,
being set in lead in small lozenge shaped squares,
made that light less, and the fire, being now all but
extinguished, was not visible on the hearth. On
awaking, Miss Chamberlain fancied she heard a
slight—<span class='it'>very slight</span> movement, or breathing in the
room, but it was so like the usual sighing amongst
the old trees on the terrace, she imagined it proceeded
from them. Yet she felt some apprehension,
accompanied by a slight palpitation of the heart.
Her eyes naturally turned toward the fire-place, but
she could at first scarcely trace the outline of the
mantel distinctly. After long gazing toward it,
however, a horrible impression began by degrees to
take possession of her mind, that she saw something
like a human being reclining before the fire, but the
idea stole over her senses so imperceptibly, that it
was long before she could bring herself to believe it
was any thing real. The antiquity of the place, the
profound solitude of the room, its distance from the
more inhabited parts of the castle, and, above all,
the singularly grotesque figures worked on the faded
arras, began by degrees to force ideas of spectral
apparitions on her mind. A slight motion of the
figure, whatever it was, at last put all doubt at rest,
and convinced her it lived and moved; but whether
it was human or brutal she could not decide. Miss
Chamberlain was naturally courageous, but the unusual
combination of circumstances kept her spell-bound.
She tried to scream, but the will refused
to obey the impulse, her eyes were riveted on the
figure, and a cold shivering rushed through her
nerves, and paralized every effort to master fear.
With eyes strained to their utmost power, she at
length fancied she could distinguish a pair of thin,
bony hands, or paws, extended over the embers as
if to gather warmth from them. Then she imagined
she could see a long grizzly gray beard hanging
down stiff from its breast or chin, but the head appeared
to be so low there was no appearance of neck.
There, however, the being or spectre certainly sat,
in the posture of an Egyptian mummy. A cloud having
passed from before the moon, a greater degree of
light was now thrown into the chamber, and, as
the spectral visitant turned toward the place
whence the ray proceeded, the lady perceived, beyond
the possibility of a doubt, that it was a man,
whose head was entirely bald, having an immensely
long white beard! The certainty appalled her—she
had neither power to move nor speak, but lay as in a
trance. Although reason did not desert her, horror
overpowered every faculty, particularly when, at
last, she saw him slowly rise from the hearth—a man
of gigantic stature—with nothing upon him but the
remains of a thin ragged garment. His rising upward
was so exceedingly slow, as if to avoid noise
or alarm, that before he attained a fully erect position
his head seemed to touch the ceiling of the lofty
room; his long spider-like limbs were of enormously
disproportionate length, and the idea entered the
appalled gazer’s mind, that the shriveled fingers
she had observed were those of a goule coming to
strangle her. The moon now showed her his giant
figure distinctly, and the dismayed lady became
petrified with horror on seeing him slowly and softly
approach the bed where she lay. Silent and stealthily
he moved until he was quite near, when, gently
raising the bed clothes on the opposite side to where
Miss Chamberlain reposed, he slid under them,
apparently perfectly unconscious that there was
any person there except himself. Who can describe
the overpowering terror and dismay which
now seized our appalled heroine? In the same
bed with a loathsome and monstrous being whose
purpose was unknown, and whose power, if exerted,
was evidently irresistible. Although utterly
deprived of volition, the lady yet retained presence
of mind sufficient to know that her only safety depended
on remaining as if perfectly unconscious and
immovable. She did not dare to draw a breath—and
surgeons know how astonishingly, how completely,
respiration may be checked and mastered in moments
of anxiety. There she lay, more dead than
alive, almost as much paralized as a corpse in a coffin,
and there too lay the demon visiter by her side,
inanimate, and, apparently, as unconscious as a
stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long did both retain their respective positions,
although once, in turning his head, Miss Chamberlain
felt his grizzly beard brush her beautiful cheek.
After a considerable interval, every second of which
seemed to her an age, he began to breathe regularly
and heavily, the sure prelude of sleep, and she
began to entertain a hope that escape was not
impossible—provided she could so far restrain her
feelings as still to hold her breath, and remain immovable.
This, by extraordinary exertion, and a
noble firmness of purpose, she was enabled to do,
and in half an hour she had the unutterable delight to
feel assured, by the uniform regularity of his breathing,
that her detested and loathsome companion was
indeed asleep. But how to escape from the bed and
the room, now became her sole consideration. It did
occur that, if she could reach the door, raise the arras,
and withdraw the bolt from the staple, without disturbing
the sleeper, she could soon gain the long
gallery through which she well remembered to have
passed, and that, although the upper quadrangle of
the castle was now still as the grave, there were
watchmen in the lodge within the entrance tower
both night and day. These, and the noble mastiffs
which she had noticed and caressed, she fully expected
to alarm in case of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cautiously and gradually she withdrew one of her
arms from under the silk coverlet, and began with
extreme care to draw aside the clothes, pausing
every second to listen whether there was the least
irregularity in his respiration; but finding it still uniform,
she became reassured, and at length succeeded
in so far disengaging herself as to be enabled to
place one foot on the matted floor. By degrees she
withdrew the other also, and leaning on her left
arm began to glide softly from the bed; in retiring
from which the slightest rustle of her drapery
seemed to her strained ear like a crash of thunder.
Well nigh did she expire with terror, when on finally
withdrawing herself, the heavy breathing of her
detested companion suddenly stopped! Already
were his long bony fingers around her throat, she
felt herself struggling, quivering, tugging in the
agonies of death, and her eyeballs starting from their
sockets. She felt all this, at least in imagination, as
the heavy breathing ceased. Providentially for her,
although the moon now shone in full upon the arras
which covered the door, the heavy velvet curtains
which fell in large folds from the frieze of the canopy
overhead threw a deep shadow where the trembling
fair one stood, and she was also partially hidden by
one of those large and high old fashioned screens,
which were then so much in use, and indeed indispensable,
for intercepting drafts of air from the huge
chimneys and ill closed windows. There in breathless
anxiety she stood, as immovable and as cold
as a marble statue. Although the dreaded giant
appeared to rise up, she soon had the inexpressible
delight to hear that he only turned on the bed, and
that it was toward the opposite side to that she
wished to gain. Long did she stand riveted to
the spot, petrified with fear and shivering with
apprehension, but she was every moment gathering
fresh courage and resolution (now that she was
relieved from such near contact with the mysterious
visiter,) and determined, with an almost preternatural
impulse, that, if assaulted, she would defend
herself to the last extremity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length she heard the breathing become again
regular, and unable longer to struggle against fear
and hope, she stepped silently but determinedly toward
the door. Cautiously and slowly was the arras
raised and put aside with the left hand, while in her
right she firmly grasped the bolt. Who can feel or
describe the rapture which fluttered her heart, as
she now bravely, fearlessly and rapidly drew the
fastening from its staple! But, as it loudly started
back, she heard the bedstead crash, and the tall
figure of that monstrous being leaped from it toward
her! The blood rushed to her heart as the
door gave way to her concentrated strength, she
rushed from the room, and flew with wild speed and
dreadful screams, along the corridor and into the
long gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any one has ever heard the quick, sharp, <span class='it'>piercing</span>
shriek of a woman in the last extremity of peril,
he can easily conceive the terrible energy of Miss
Chamberlain’s screams to escape from her pursuer,
and awaken the Duke of Rutland and his gallant
son. The deep shrillness of her anguished cries
pierced every ear throughout the towers of Haddon.
At that still moment, in the dead hour of midnight,
there was not one living creature within the walls,
but started up appalled. The dogs set up a most dismal
howl, and the castle bell quickly rung out its
deafening tones on the night air. Upward of one
hundred and thirty persons, who had been reposing
in confident security, were flying in every direction.
The watchmen in the entrance tower seized
their iron lamps, flew across the lower quadrangle and
rushed up the stone staircase leading to the state apartments,
which they reached almost in a second, and to
their inexpressible relief found the duke hurrying
toward the long gallery, accompanied by his intrepid
heir, who grasped a gleaming sabre in his hand.
The awful screams, they knew, proceeded from
that quarter of the building, but alas, if those terrific
sounds had arisen suddenly, they had as suddenly
ceased, for all was now hushed and still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Granby, preceding his father, flew toward
the gallery, joined at every step by his numerous
friends, and servants bearing lights, and arriving at
the foot of the well known circular steps, which lead
up to the gallery, he found, to his horror and dismay,
the body of Miss Chamberlain lying on her
face, in a pool of blood which was streaming from
her mouth, whilst her long beautiful hair and dress
were in the wildest disorder. Groans of mingled
pity and indignation burst from all present, but it
was no time to stand still. The marquis threw aside
his sword, and kneeling down, raised the bleeding
victim in his arms; but all animation was extinct,
and life itself had apparently left her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By desire of the duke’s physician, the body was
immediately borne to the apartments of the Countess
of Carlisle, whilst the groom of the chambers led on
the now large assembly to the apartment which had
been assigned to the maiden. On reaching it a single
glance revealed that it had been occupied by two persons,
but who it was that had dared to violate the
lady’s privacy, remained a mystery, for the apartment
was now as still and desolate as when its doors were
first opened to the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thorough search throughout the entire castle
was instantly commenced. As the fastening of Miss
Chamberlain’s apartment was on the inside, and
could not be opened from without, it was plain that
the intruder, whoever he was, must have concealed
himself there before she retired. On this subject
the groom of the chambers underwent a long and
close examination, but nothing was elicited from him
which tended in the remotest degree toward a discovery
of the mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was remarked, and well remembered, that the
whole of the gentlemen had remained in the great
hall long after the ladies had retired to their respective
apartments, and the eagerness with which every
guest or retainer now joined in the search, indicated
their general earnestness for the instant investigation
of the subject, and the detection and punishment of
the bold adventurer who had been guilty of the wanton
and unparalleled crime. Every effort, however,
was unavailing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, by a prompt application of the lancet,
and other usual restoratives, the ladies had the unspeakable
pleasure of seeing Miss Chamberlain begin
to show signs of returning animation. The physician,
however, gave strict injunctions that on the
return of her reason no allusion whatever should be
made to the terrible circumstances under which she
was found, and that should she herself show an inclination
to speak of them she should as gently as
possibly be restrained. The Countess of Carlisle sat
by her side, and with tender solicitude endeavored
by every means which affection and good sense could
suggest, to soothe and quiet her mind. In this she
was so successful that although her lovely protégé
had a long succession of fainting fits, she was finally
near the break of day lulled into a gentle sleep, from
which after a few hours she awoke perfectly rational.
When she was apparently about to speak of her adventure
the countess informed her of the physician’s
desire that she should refrain from mentioning the
occurrences of the night until she had gained more
strength, as it had been found that the injuries occasioned
by her fall were so severe that her immediate
restoration could be accomplished only by more
than usual carefulness and quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day, however, the restriction
was removed, and during the afternoon, as the
Duchess of Rutland and Lady Carlisle were sitting
beside the couch on which she reclined, she related
to them nearly all the particulars with which the
reader is now acquainted, but added that after her
escape through the door of her apartment, she could
recollect nothing whatever, except a frightful concussion,
as if she had been suddenly struck down
and killed by the dreaded spectre whom she supposed
to be in pursuit of her. This was doubtless
occasioned by the severity of her fall down the steps,
the effect of which was increased tenfold by the
velocity of her flight along the gallery, unconscious
that there was any stair before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more thorough search having been instituted in
the room which Miss Chamberlain had occupied, it
was discovered that under the arras, behind the bed,
and <span class='it'>close to the floor</span>, there was a small square sliding
panel, of sufficient size to admit a man’s body. Such
contrivances, in ancient buildings, not unfrequently
lead into secret passages, but here, contrary to the
usual custom, instead of descending it gradually
rose within the massive pile of stone. The walls
of old castellated buildings are sometimes of extraordinary
thickness, varying from six to eighteen feet.
This dark passage at Haddon, evidently erected for
purposes of secrecy and safety during the feudal
times, appeared to be coeval with the most ancient
towers of the edifice, and it was quite unknown to
any servant, or even to a member of the Rutland
family. After ascending to a considerable height
it again descended and led into a subterranean passage
which was followed with much difficulty, from
the decay and falling in of the stones which once had
formed the steps of stairs. There were also two or
three abrupt, acute angles, which, at their turning,
branched off and divided into others, but one of these
was always found (after following it for some distance)
to end in what is called a <span class='it'>blind alley</span>; apparently
intended to mislead or waylay any one in
pursuit who was unacquainted with the intricacies
and windings of the labyrinth. The true path was,
therefore, followed with extreme difficulty, particularly
as the air within it was so impure that
lights could not easily be made to burn. It was
ultimately found that the passage terminated behind
a handsome gothic stone pavilion which was erected
on the upper terrace of the garden, and within a
foot of the high wall that serves as an embankment
to retain the steep rising ground of the hill
park. The pavilion was overgrown with old tangled
ivy, and encircled with aged lilac bushes, pleached
and intertwisted so closely, in every fantastic form,
as to preclude the possibility of ingress or egress
through them, toward the back of the building, and
there was no other way of getting at the secret
entrance behind the pavilion, except by climbing
over the pinnacle stone roof, a feat impossible without
a ladder, or by going round into the hill park,
and there descending by the very narrow space <span class='it'>between</span>
the back wall of the pavilion and the stone
rampart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miserable and monstrous creature who had
occasioned the catastrophe which had so nearly
proved fatal to Miss Chamberlain, was soon discovered,
by the sagacity of a favorite beagle belonging
to the duke, hid in the hollow of an old oak,
which grew in the bottom of a secluded dell in a
distant part of the park. When found, he was
lying asleep, coiled up more in the manner of an
adder than of a human being. His appearance when
he emerged from the tree was indeed frightful, as, in
addition to a stature far above the common standard,
he was emaciated to the last degree of attenuation—a
perfect living skeleton. His head was, as Miss
Chamberlain had stated, entirely bald, and his long
grizzly white beard hung down nearly to his waist.
But beyond all these revolting circumstances, there
was a terrific wildness in his manner and look which
might well occasion doubts whether he was not some
“goblin damned.” It turned out, however, that he
was a harmless lunatic, who had escaped from an
asylum in the vicinity. How he had discovered the
secret passage leading into the castle, he could not or
would not divulge. When the keeper of the asylum
arrived to reclaim him, by the power which such
people invariably acquire over maniacs he soon ascertained
that for nearly a month previously he had
frequented the room which had so unfortunately been
assigned to the heroine of our history, and during the
nights reposed on the bed; and that he had sustained
life in the mean time by the exertion of that inexplicable
cunning with which maniacs are so frequently
endowed, enabling him, without detection, to plunder
the butler’s pantry during the silence and darkness of
the nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a native of Darly Dale, in the immediate
neighborhood, and as Haddon, like most houses of
the English nobility, was then, as it still is, freely
shown to strangers, he had probably before he was
deprived of reason become acquainted with the intricacies
of the ancient Hall. The reason why he
selected it as his place of retreat on escaping from
the asylum arose, it was believed, from his having
been a rejected suitor of pretty Maude, the house-keeper’s
daughter. The painful circumstance of
his rejection had bereft the unfortunate being of
reason. Sooth to say, the charms of Maude, if the
traditions may be credited, had captivated one much
less likely to be rejected than her gigantic admirer—no
less a person than the then humble retainer of the
Duke of Rutland but in after years commander-in-chief
of the English cavalry, who at the bloody battle
of Minden, by one irresistible charge performed at
the exact moment when victory or defeat hung vibrating
in the scales, gained for himself and his country
immortal honor, by the total overthrow and rout of
the French army.</p>

<div><h1><a id='cha'></a>CHARACTERLESS WOMEN.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. SEBA SMITH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coleridge has somewhere beautifully said, “the
perfection of a woman’s character is to be characterless.”
A sentiment of such obvious propriety
would hardly seem to need a commentary, and yet
no one of Coleridge’s appears to be oftener misunderstood.
A characterless woman is, assuredly, any
thing but an imbecile one. She must be one equal
to all contingencies, whose faculties or powers are
developed by circumstances, rather than by spontaneous
action; and this implies the possession of all
that is peculiar to her sex, but all in harmonious
adjustment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A characterless woman is often confounded with
one deficient in the finest attributes of the sex, who
is characterless indeed, but is so from imbecility—if
the phrase do not, of itself, involve a contradiction;
as if a creature, whose virtues were all negatives,
could be characterless! A woman, too feeble to
grasp at thought, too vapid for sentiment, too tame
for mirth, too commonplace for enthusiasm, and too
weak for passion, may be the ideal of those incapable
of appreciating the higher characteristics of
womanhood, but could never have been that of him
whom Wordsworth calls the “heaven-eyed creature;”
of him who conceived Christabel, and the
sweet attaching Genevieve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such may do for the statue-like creations of Maria
Edgeworth, and the thousand and one other romance
writers, who expect woman to move by rule—who
mistake dullness for goodness, and apathy for grace;
but they awaken in ourselves no emotions of sympathy,
for the human heart can respond only to <span class='it'>human</span>
emotions, and it at once goes forth to greet its
kindred impulses. Fielding’s Sophia is more lovable
than Scott’s Rowena, simply because one is a live,
earnest woman, and the other designed to be a very
perfect one, and she turns out to be a very dull one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let Rebecca pass—the noble—the ideal—for, alas!
human hearts are not prepared for the love of
such as these; they may excite esteem, admiration,
even passion, but love—the crowning boon of existence—may
not be theirs. They gather not the
household gods about them—they enter themselves
into the holiest of holies, but they minister alone at
the altar. Their fate is that of the fabled bird,
whose own intensity kindled its funeral pyre. They
have a mission to perform. They are created not to
enjoy but to suffer; aye, to suffer that human hearts
may be made wiser and holier; therefore do the
pale stars keep vigil with them, and therefore is
the dew all night upon their heads, and their locks
wet with the drops of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A characterless woman! We feel she must be so,
to be perfect as a woman. But then she must have
all the susceptibilities, all the sweet impulses, all the
weaknesses of her sex; she must have a woman’s
thoughts, and a woman’s utterance—her simplicity,
her faith—and, beneath all, there must dwell that
womanly endurance—wondrous and holy in its
power—reserved for the day of trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weakness as often imports character as strength.
Any one attribute, in excess, imports a distinctive
characteristic. We talk of vain women, coquettish,
masculine, sensible, dull, witty, &amp;c., running through
all the defective grades of character. Now a true
woman must, as circumstances warrant, exhibit
something of all this; for she is a “creature of infinite
variety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She may have a dash of coquetry, but be no
coquette—she hath pride, but may not be called
proud—hath vanity, but is not vain—she suggests,
rather than originates wit—wise she is, but, as
Rosalind saith, “the wiser, the waywarder”—she is
devout, but no devotee—she is good, but hers is not
that dry, barren goodness, which ariseth from cold
speculating reason, but is rather that of a beautiful
instinct, that causeth her to feel that God hath done
infinitely better for her than she could have done for
herself. Like Desdemona, she will blush at the mention
of herself, feeling she is so nicely balanced—and
then, with a woman’s best and sweetest attribute, she
spreadeth forth her hand for support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let the crowning grace of womanhood be, that
she is characterless. The beautiful and beloved of all
ages may be thus defined. With all the queenly
attributes of Isabella, of Spain, we feel she was all
of woman. So was the lonely and unfortunate Mary
Stuart, and she still holdeth a place in our hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan, of Arc, Catharine de Medici, Mary and
Elizabeth, of England, were all characters. We
will not analize them, nor the emotions they excite,
but simply cite them as illustrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meek sister of Lazarus—she who sat at the
feet—the gentle Mary, who was most honored with
the friendship of the Savior, whom he could not reproach,
even though incited thereto by her sister,
was beautiful in her womanhood—so was the mother
of Jesus. A character is affixed to Martha, and to
Mary the Magdalene. History is full of examples
in support of our theory. Josephine was characterless,
except in her sorrows; and too often do we
find the lovely and beloved distinguished thus, and
we weep with them, feeling we are beguiled, not
challenged to sympathy. Mrs. Hemans, who hath
given such eloquent utterance to a woman’s soul,
must have embodied all the attributes of womanhood,
and all in harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shakspeare everywhere discriminates between his
characters and his true women, those that are to be
a part of the drama of life as the actors, the women
swayed by discordant passions, and those that appeal
to our love. Never does he confound them. Those
that are designed for our love are not characters.
Whatever maybe their dignity, their intellect, their
fortunes, they are still women. The grace of womanhood
invests all they say, and all they do. Such
are Portia, Cordelia, Desdemona, Ophelia, Rosalind,
&amp;c. His characters may excite our admiration, our
mirth, or abhorrence, but they find no lodgement in
our hearts. Such are Cressida, Cleopatra, Lady
Macbeth, Kate, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Milton, Eve is characterless, till she hath
fallen, and Spenser’s Amoret sits in the very “lap of
womanhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Need we call Byron’s Medora weak, because she is
supremely tender and feminine? Weakness creates
eccentricities, and she had none. Gulnare hath
character, and we recoil from her, as did the Corsair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But enough—it is the “story without an end,” to
be read from the time that Eve first became a type
of womanhood, down to the time when her sex shall
realize all that of which she was prophetic.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE DOOM OF THE DART.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The day had been close and sultry, but, as sunset
drew on, a light breeze sprung up, which diffused a
delicious coolness throughout the ship, imparting
new vigor to the panting and almost exhausted men.
Invigorated by the welcome wind, a group of us
gathered on the weather quarter to behold the sun
go down; and those who have never seen such a
spectacle at sea can have no idea of the vastness
with which it fills the mind. Slowly the broad disc
wheeled down toward the west, seeming to dilate
as it approached the horizon, and, as its lower edge
touched the distant seaboard, trailing a long line of
golden light across the undulating surface of the
deep. At this instant the scene was magnificent.
Pile on pile of clouds, assuming every fantastic
shape, and varying from red to purple and from
purple to gold, lay heaped around the setting god. For
a few moments the billows could be seen rising and
falling against the broad disc of the descending luminary:
while, with a slow and scarcely perceptible
motion, he gradually slid beneath the horizon. Insensibly
the brilliant hues of the clouds died away,
changing from gorgeous crimson, through almost
every gradation of color, until at length a faint apple-green
invested the whole western sky, slowly fading
into a deep azure, as it approached the zenith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful!” exclaimed the skipper, “one might
almost become poetical in gazing on such a scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had now been hid for some minutes, and
the apple-green of the sky was rapidly becoming
colder and more indistinct, though the edge of a
solitary dark cloud, hanging a few degrees above
the horizon, was yet tipped with a faint crimson.
Meantime the stars began to appear in the opposite
firmament, one after another twinkling into sight, as
if by magic, until the whole eastern heaven was
gemmed with them. I looked around the horizon.
Never before had its immensity so forcibly impressed
me. The vast concave swelling high up above me
and gradually rounding away toward the distant
seaboard, seemed almost of illimitable extent; and
when, over all the mighty space of ocean included
within its circuit, my eye rested on not a solitary
sail, I experienced a sensation of loneliness such as
no pen can describe. And when the breeze again
died away, leaving the sails idly flapping to and fro as
the schooner rocked on the swell, my imagination
suggested that perhaps it might be our doom, as it
had been that of others, to lie for days, nay weeks
and months, powerless in the midst of that desert
latitude, shut out from the world, enclosed within the
blue walls of that gigantic prison: and I shuddered,
as well I might, at the very idea of such a fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now a dead calm. No perceptible agitation
could be discovered on the surface of the deep,
except the long undulating swell which never subsides,
and which can be compared to nothing but the
heavy breathing of some gigantic monster when
lulled to repose. Now and then, however, a tiny
ripple, occasioned by the gambols of some equally
tiny inhabitant of the deep, would twinkle sharp in
the starlight; while, close under the shadow of our
hull, a keen eye might detect hundreds of the fairy
fire-flies of the ocean, their phosphoric lanterns
glittering gaily as they shot to and fro. Absorbed in
the contemplation of the spectacle, I suffered more
than half an hour to pass unheeded; and it was not
until the sea began to be sensibly agitated, and the
wind to freshen, that I looked up. The change
which had come over the firmament astonished me,
and requires a passing description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had last looked at the heavens, the whole
eastern sky was thick sown with stars, though no
moon had as yet appeared. Along the western seaboard
still stretched the long line of pale apple-green
which the setting sun had painted in that quarter.
The firmament overhead was without a cloud, its
dark azure surface spangled with stars. Between
the zenith and the eastern horizon hung the dark
cloud which I have already mentioned, a black
opaque mass of vapor apparently not larger than a
capstan head. But every thing now presented a
different aspect. The first thing that met my eye
was the upper portion of the disc of the moon,
peeping above the eastern seaboard, the dark fiery
red of its face betraying the existence of a thin mist
in that direction. Fascinated by the sight, I remained
gazing for more than a minute on the rising
luminary, as she emerged gracefully and majestically
from her watery bed. At length, and apparently
with an accelerated motion, she slid suddenly
above the line of the horizon, pouring a line of silver
light along the crests of the undulating swell, while
instantaneously, as if putting on all her glory, she
emerged from the mist that had surrounded her, and
rolled on in pearly brightness, calm and undimmed,
the stars fading before her approach. One planet
alone remained visible—it was the evening star,
walking in almost equal beauty, a little to the right
of her sister luminary. Never before had those fine
lines of Milton, in which he pictures her as leading on
the choral hosts of heaven, rose so vividly before
my imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I turned my gaze westward, how different
the spectacle that met my eye! The little cloud
which I have described, had grown to a gigantic
size, and now obscured the whole larboard firmament,
extending its dark and jagged front a third of
the way around the horizon, and piling its gloomy
masses high up toward the zenith. Here and there,
where a thinner edge than usual was disclosed to the
light, it caught the rays of the rising luminary which
it reflected back, so that the cloud seemed lined with
silver. The sea, immediately under this gloomy
bank of vapor, was of the color of ink, and reminded
me of the fabled waters of Acheron. The whole
spectacle was calculated to fill the mind with dark
and ominous forebodings; and, I confess, my own
feelings partook of this uneasy character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind was rapidly freshening; but, instead of
setting in steadily from any quarter, it blew in fitful
gusts, chopping all round the horizon. Yet it brought
a delicious coolness with it, which was peculiarly
refreshing after the heat of the day. The sea now
began to rise, and as the dark billows heaved up in
the spectral light, they wore an aspect so ghastly
that I almost shuddered to look on them—an aspect,
however, that was partially relieved when the unquiet
puffs of air crisped their edges into silver, or
rolled a sheet of crackling light along their surface.
With the freshening of the wind the schooner began
slowly to move ahead, but, ever and anon, as the
breeze died away, or struck her from a new quarter,
she would settle like a log on the water, moaning as
if in pain. At such times the dying cadence of the
wind, wailing through the rigging, smote on the ear
with strange, weird power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A threatening prospect,” said the skipper, approaching
me, and breaking the profound silence
which had reigned for several minutes, “we shall
have a tempest before long, and I fear it will be no
child’s play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw such ominous signs before. The
very air seems oppressed and sick, as if it trembled
at approaching ruin. Mark the faces even of our
oldest veterans—they betray a vague sentiment
of fear, such as I never saw on their countenances
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye!” replied the skipper, abstractedly, for he
was gazing anxiously astern, “the cloud comes up
like a race-horse. How it whirls over and over,
rolling its dark masses along; it reminds me of the
mountains which the old Titans, we read of in school,
heaved against Jove. But here am I thinking of
classic fables when I ought to be taking in sail.
Ho!” he exclaimed, lifting his voice, as a sharp gust,
premonitory of the coming hurricane, whistled across
the hamper, “in sail—every rag!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time was to be lost. During the short space
we had been conversing, the dark clouds astern had
increased their velocity threefold, and, even as the
skipper spoke, the most advanced of them had over-shadowed
us with its sepulchral pall. As the momentary
puff of air accompanying it died away, a
few large heavy rain-drops pattered on the deck,
and then all was still again. The men sprung to
their stations, at the voice of their superior, and
incited to double activity by these signs of approaching
danger, soon reduced our canvass until the
schooner lay, with bare poles, rocking on the swell.
Scarcely had this task been completed, when the
gale burst on us in all its fury, roaring, hissing, and
howling through the rigging, and drenching us with
the clouds of spray that it tore from the bosom of the
deep and bore onward in its fierce embraces. For
a few minutes we could scarcely stand before the
blast. The schooner groaned, and starting forward
at the first touch of the hurricane, like a steed when
he feels the spur, went careering along, her tall
masts curving over in the gale, and her hull shrouded
in the flying spray which drove onward with even
greater velocity than ourselves. In this desperate
encounter with the elements, every rope and stick
strained and cracked almost to breaking. All at
once this hurricane died out, and then an awful stillness
fell on the scene. Not a voice spoke, not a
footfall was heard, scarcely a breath broke the appalling
silence. The schooner rose and fell ominously
on the agitated swell. Suddenly a flash of
lightning played far off on the dark edges of the
cloud behind us, and then followed a low hoarse
growl of distant thunder. Scarcely a minute elapsed
before a large rain-drop fell on my face, and instantaneously,
as if the heavens were opened before us, a
deluge of rain rushed downwards, hissing and
seething along the decks, and almost pinning us to
our places; while the wind, bursting out afresh,
swept wildly across the sea, and driving the spray and
rain madly before it, produced a scene of confusion
and tumult almost indescribable. For some minutes
I could see nothing in the thick darkness which
now surrounded us—could hear nothing but the roar
of the hurricane and the splash of the waters. But
suddenly a blinding flash shot from a cloud almost
directly overhead, lighting up the deck, spars, and
guns, for an instant, with a supernatural glare, and
striking the ocean a few fathoms distant, ploughed up
the waters, which it flung in volumes of spray in
every direction. Before a clock could tick, the
report followed, stunning us with its deafening roar,
and rattling and crackling fearfully as it echoed
down the sky. Never shall I forget the ghastly looks
of the men, as I beheld them in that unearthly glare.
And minutes after darkness had resumed its sway,
and the roar of the thunder had died in the distance,
my eyes still ached with that intense light, and the
crackling of the bolt rung in my ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the rain descended in torrents, not,
however, falling vertically, but flying whistling
before the hurricane. The uproar of the elements
now became terrific. The thunder rattled incessantly—the
wind shrieked through the hamper—every
timber and spar groaned in the strife, and the
deep boom of the angry surges, pursuing in our
wake, sounded like the howlings of beasts of prey.
The darkness was intense, only relieved by the glare
of the lightning which streamed incessantly over the
scene. Whither we were going it was impossible
to tell, for all control of the schooner had been given
up, and we were scudding before the tempest with
breathless velocity. A quarter of an hour had thus
passed, when I found myself standing by the skipper,
who was watching the course of the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“East, by east-sou’-east,” he said, “and driving
like death. God of heaven, what a storm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words had scarcely left his mouth before
another peal of thunder, even more awful than the
preceding one I have described, burst overhead, and,
stunning us for an instant with its terrific explosion,
rattled down the sky, crackling and re-crackling in
its retreat, as if the firmament were crashing to its
centre: it was accompanied rather than preceded by
a flash, such as I had never seen before, blinding me
instantaneously with its glare, and making every
object swim dizzily before the brain. On the moment
I felt a stunning shock, and was prostrated on
the deck, while a strong smell of sulphur pervaded
the atmosphere. The deluge of rain revived me,
and I looked up in alarm. Good God! the foremast
was in flames. <span class='it'>We had been struck with lightning!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick as thought the whole horrors of our situation
rose before me. We were on a pathless sea amid
a raging storm. That there was little hope of extinguishing
the flames was evident, for, even while
these thoughts flashed through my mind, a volume of
smoke puffed up through the forecastle, and a cry
ran through the decks that the whole forward part of
the schooner was on fire. There was no time, however,
to be lost, if we would make any effort to save
ourselves; and, faint as was the hope of success, it
was determined to attempt to smother the flames, by
fastening down the hatches and excluding the air.
But the fierce heat that filled the decks told us that
the endeavor would be in vain; nor was it long before
the forehatch was blown up with a loud explosion,
while a stream of fire shot high up into the
air; and, the next minute, the forked tongues had
caught hold of the rigging, wrapping shrouds, ropes
and yards in a sheet of lurid flame. The rapidity with
which all this occurred was incredible. It seemed
as if but a minute had elapsed since that terrific
bolt had burst above us, and now the whole forward
part of the schooner was a mass of fire, that streamed
out before the tempest like a blood-red banner;
showers of sparks, and even burning fragments of
the wreck, flying far away ahead on the gale. There
are periods, however, even of long duration, which
appear to be but momentary, and so it was now. So
wholly had every energy been devoted to the preservation
of the ship, that the time had passed almost unnoticed,
though a full half hour had elapsed since we
had been struck with lightning. The storm, however,
still raged as furiously as ever; for, though the rain
was less violent, the wind blew a hurricane, threatening
to settle down into a long sustained gale. Had
the torrents of water, which first drenched us, continued
falling, there might have been some hope of
extinguishing the flames; but the subsidence of the
rain, and the unaltered violence of the wind,
rendered the situation of the schooner hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can do nothing more, I fear,” at length said
the skipper, drawing me aside, “the fire is on the
increase, and even the elements have turned against
us. We must leave the little <span class='sc'>Dart</span> to her fate, unless
you can think of something else to do?” and he
looked inquiringly at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” I replied, with a mournful shake of my
head, “we have done every thing that mortal man
can do; but in vain. We must now think of saving
ourselves. Had we not better order out the boats?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skipper did not, for a moment, reply to my
question, but stood, with his arms folded on his
breast, and a face of the deepest dejection, gazing on
the burning forecastle. At length he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many a long day have we sailed together, in
many a bold fray have we fought for each other, and
now to leave you, my gallant craft, ah! little did I
think this would be your doom. But God’s will be
done. We must all perish sooner or later, and better
go down here than rot, a forgotten hulk, on some
muddy shore—better consume to ashes than fall a
prey to some huge cormorant of an enemy. And
yet,” he continued, his eye lighting up, “and yet I
should have wished to die with you under the guns
of one of those gigantic monsters—aye! die battling
for the possession of your deck inch by inch.” At
this instant one of the forward guns, which had become
heated almost to redness in the conflagration,
exploded. The sound seemed to recall him to himself.
He started as if roused from a reverie, and,
noticing me beside him, recollected my question.
Immediately resuming his usual energy, he proceeded
to order out the boats, and provide provisions
and a few hasty instruments, with a calmness which
was in striking contrast to the raging sea around,
and the lurid fire raging on our bows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The high discipline of the men enabled us to complete
our preparations in a space of time less than
one half that which would have been consumed by
an ordinary crew under like circumstances; and, indeed,
in many cases, all subordination would have
been lost, and perhaps the ruin of the whole been the
consequence. The alacrity of the men and the forecast
of the officers were indeed needed; for our preparations
had scarcely been completed when the
heat on the deck became intolerable. The fire had
now reached the after hatch, and, notwithstanding
the violence of the gale, was extending aft with great
rapidity, and had already enveloped the mainmast in
its embraces. For some time before we left the
schooner the heat, even at the tafferel, almost
scorched the skin from our faces; nor did we descend
into the boats a minute too soon. This was a
feat also by no means easily accomplished, so great
was the agitation of the sea. As I looked on the frail
boats which were to receive us, and thought of the
perils which environed us, of our distance from land,
and the slight quantity of provisions we had been
enabled to save, I felt that, in all human probability,
we should never again set foot on shore, even if we
survived until morning. To my own fate I was comparatively
indifferent, for life had now lost all charms
to me; but when I reflected on the brave men who
were to be consigned to the same destiny, and of the
ties by which many of them were bound to earth—of
the wives who would become widows, of aged parents
who would be left childless, of children for
whom the orphan’s lot was preparing—the big tears
gushed into my eyes, and coursed down my cheek,
though unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready,” said the skipper, who was the last to
leave the deck, and pausing to cast a mournful look
at his little craft, he sprung into the boat and we
pushed off from the quarter. For some minutes,
however, it seemed doubtful whether our frail barges
could live in the tumultuous sea that now raged. One
minute we were hurried to the sky on the bosom of
a wave, and then we plunged headlong into the dark
trough below, the walls of water on either hand momently
threatening to overwhelm us. But though
small, our boats were buoyant, and rode gallantly
onward. Every exertion was made, meanwhile, to
increase our distance from the schooner, for our departure
had been hurried by the fear that the fire
would soon reach the magazine, and our proximity
to the burning ship still continued to threaten us with
destruction in case of an explosion. The men, conscious
of the peril, strained every sinew to effect our
object, and thus battling against wind and wave we
struggled on our way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With every fathom we gained, the sight of the
burning ship increased in magnificence. The flames
had now seized the whole after part of the schooner
as far back as the companion way, so that hull, spars
and rigging were a sheet of fire, which, caught in
the fierce embraces of the hurricane, now whirled
around, now streamed straight out, and now broke
into a thousand forked tongues, licking up the masts
and around the spars like so many fiery serpents.
Millions of sparks poured down to leeward, while
ever and anon huge patches of flame would be torn
from the main body of the conflagration and blown
far away ahead. Volumes of dark, pitchy smoke,
curling up from the decks of the schooner, often partially
concealed a portion of the flames, but they reappeared
a moment afterwards with even greater
vividness. In some places so intense was the conflagration
that the fire was at a white heat. The
whole horizon was illuminated with the light, except
just over and ahead of the schooner, where a black
smoky cloud had gathered, looking like the wing of
some gigantic monster of another world; and no description
can adequately picture the spectral aspect
of the gloomy waves that rolled up their ghastly
crests beneath this canopy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cannot last much longer,” said the doctor,
who was in my boat, “the flames will soon reach
the magazine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye! aye! and look there—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I spoke, a vivid, blinding jet of fire streamed
high up into the air, while the masts of the schooner
could be seen, amid the flame, shooting arrow-like
to the sky. Instantaneously a roar as of ten thousand
batteries smote the ear; and then came the pattering
of fragments of the hull and spars as they fell on the
water. Even while these sounds continued, a darkness
that brought to my mind that of the day of doom
enveloped us, though that intense light still swam in
our eyes, producing a thousand fantastic images on
the retina. No word was spoken, but each one held
his breath in awe; and then came a long, deep
drawn sigh, that seemed to proceed simultaneously
from each one in the boat. <span class='it'>The Dart was no more.</span>
We were alone in the boundless deep, alone with a
storm still raging around us, alone without any hope
of rescue, and a thousand miles from land. God
only knew whether it would be our lot to perish by
starvation, or sink at an earlier hour a prey to the
overwhelming deep! As I contemplated our situation
I shuddered, and breathed an involuntary prayer
that the latter might be our doom.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a poet,” says Mr. Griswold, in his late
“Poets and Poetry of America,” “the standing of
Mr. Dawes is as yet unsettled; there being a wide
difference of opinion respecting his writings.” The
<span class='it'>width</span> of this difference is apparent; and, while to
many it is matter for wonder, to those who have the
interest of our Literature at heart, it is, more properly,
a source of mortification and regret. That
the author in question has long enjoyed what we term
“a high poetical reputation,” cannot be denied; and
in no manner is this point more strikingly evinced
than in the choice of his works, some two years
since, by one of our most enterprising publishers, as
the <span class='it'>initial</span> volume of a series, the avowed object of
which was the setting forth, in the best array of
paper, type and pictorial embellishment, the <span class='it'>élite</span> of
the American poets. As a writer of occasional
stanzas he has been long before the public; always
eliciting, from a great variety of sources, <span class='it'>unqualified</span>
commendation. With the exception of a solitary remark,
adventured by ourselves in “A Chapter on
Autography,” there has been no written dissent from
the universal opinion in his favor—the universal
<span class='it'>apparent</span> opinion. Mr. Griswold’s observation must
be understood, we presume, as referring to the <span class='it'>conversational</span>
opinion upon this topic; or it is not impossible
that he holds in view the difference between
the criticism of the newspaper paragraphs and the
private comment of the educated and intelligent. Be
this as it may, the rapidly growing “reputation” of
our poet was much enhanced by the publication of
his first compositions “of length,” and attained its
climax, we believe, upon the public recitation, by
himself, of a tragic drama, in five acts, entitled
“Athenia of Damascus,” to a large assembly of admiring
and applauding <span class='it'>friends</span>, gathered together for
the occasion in one of the halls of the University of
New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This popular decision, so frequent and so public,
in regard to the poetical ability of Mr. Dawes, might
be received as evidence of his actual merit (and by
thousands it <span class='it'>is</span> so received) were it not too scandalously
at variance with a species of criticism which
<span class='it'>will not</span> be resisted—with the perfectly simple precepts
of the very commonest common sense. The
peculiarity of Mr. Griswold’s observation has induced
us to make inquiry into the true character of
the volume to which we have before alluded, and
which embraces, we believe, the chief portion of the
published verse-compositions of its author.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> This
inquiry has but resulted in the confirmation of our
previous opinion; and we now hesitate not to say,
that no man in America has been more shamefully
over-estimated than the one who forms the subject
of this article. We say shamefully; for, though a
better day is now dawning upon our literary interests,
and a laudation so indiscriminate will never be
sanctioned again—the laudation in this instance, as
it stands upon record, must be regarded as a laughable
although bitter satire upon the general zeal,
accuracy and independence of that critical spirit
which, but a few years ago, pervaded and degraded
the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what we shall say we have no intention of being
profound. Here is a case in which any thing like
analysis would be utterly thrown away. Our purpose
(which is truth) will be more fully answered by
an unvarnished exposition of fact. It appears to us,
indeed, that in excessive <span class='it'>generalization</span> lies one of
the leading errors of a criticism employed upon a
poetical literature so immature as our own. We
rhapsodize rather than discriminate; delighting more
in the dictation or discussion of a principle, than in
its particular and methodical application. The wildest
and most erratic effusion of the Muse, not utterly
worthless, will be found more or less indebted to
<span class='it'>method</span> for whatever of value it embodies; and we
shall discover, conversely, that, in any analysis of
even this wildest effusion, we labor without method
only to labor without end. There is little reason for
that vagueness of comment which, of late, we so
pertinaciously affect, and which has been brought
into fashion, no doubt, through the proverbial facility
and security of merely general remark. In regard
to the leading principles of true poesy, these, we
think, stand not at all in need of the elucidation hourly
wasted upon them. Founded in the unerring instincts
of our nature, they are enduring and immutable.
In a rigid scrutiny of any number of directly
conflicting opinions upon a poetical topic, we will
not fail to perceive that principles identical in every
important point have been, in each opinion, either
asserted, or intimated, or unwittingly allowed an influence.
The differences of decision arose simply
from those of application; and from such variety in
the applied, rather than in the conceived idea, sprang,
undoubtedly, the absurd distinctions of the “schools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Geraldine</span>” is the title of the first and longest
poem in the volume before us. It embraces some
three hundred and fifty stanzas—the whole being a
most servile imitation of the “Don Juan” of Lord
Byron. The outrageous absurdity of the systematic
<span class='it'>digression</span> in the British original, was so managed as
to form not a little portion of its infinite interest and
humor; and the fine discrimination of the writer
pointed out to him a limit beyond which he never
ventured with this tantalizing species of drollery.
“Geraldine” may be regarded, however, as a simple
embodiment of the whole soul of digression. It is a
mere mass of irrelevancy, amid the mad <span class='it'>farrago</span> of
which we detect with difficulty even the faintest vestige
of a narrative, and where the continuous lapse
from impertinence to impertinence is seldom justified
by any shadow of appositeness or even of the commonest
relation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To afford the reader any proper conception of the
<span class='it'>story</span> is of course a matter of difficulty; we must
content ourselves with a mere outline of the general
conduct. This we shall endeavor to give without
indulgence in those feelings of risibility stirred up in
us by the primitive perusal. We shall rigorously
avoid every species of exaggeration, and confine
ourselves, with perfect honesty, to the conveyance
of a distinct image.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geraldine,” then, opens with some four or five
stanzas descriptive of a sylvan scene in America.
We could, perhaps, render Mr. Dawes’ poetical
reputation no greater service than by the quotation
of these simple verses in full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is an air of quietude in good keeping with
the theme; the “giant waves” in the last stanza redeem
it from much exception otherwise; and perhaps
we need say nothing at all of the suspicious-looking
compound “mult<span class='it'>a</span>-flora.” Had Mr. Dawes
always written even nearly so well, we should have
been spared to-day the painful task imposed upon us
by a stern sense of our critical duty. These passages

to “Peerless America,” including apostrophes to
Allston and Claude Lorraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now learn the name of the tenant of the cottage,
which is <span class='it'>Wilton</span>, and ascertain that he has an
only daughter. A single stanza quoted at this juncture
will aid the reader’s conception of the queer
tone of philosophical rhapsody with which the poem
teems, and some specimen of which is invariably
made to follow each little modicum of incident.</p>

as a glorious specimen of the concentrated essence
of rigmarole, and, to say nothing of their utter absurdity

grotesquely out of place, that we found it impossible
to refrain, during their perusal, from a most unbecoming

<p class='pindent'>This filling has been, with us at least, a matter of
no little difficulty. We believe, however, that the
affair is intended to run thus:—Waldron is enticed
to some vile sins by Bore, and the knowledge of
these, on the part of Alice, places the former gentleman
in her power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are now introduced to a <span class='it'>fête champêtre</span> at the
residence of Acus, who, by the way, has a son, Clifford,
a suitor to Geraldine with the approbation of
her father—that good old gentleman, for whom our
sympathies were excited in the beginning of things,
being influenced by the consideration that this scion
of the house of the tailor will inherit a plum. The
worst of the whole is, however, that the romantic
Geraldine, who should have known better, and who
loves Waldron, loves also the young knight of the
shears. The consequence is a rencontre of the rival
suitors at the <span class='it'>fête champêtre</span>; Waldron knocking his
antagonist on the head, and throwing him into the
lake. The murderer, as well as we can make out the
narrative, now joins a piratical band, among whom
he alternately cuts throats and sings songs of his own
composition. In the mean time the deserted Geraldine
mourns alone, till, upon a certain day,</p>

writes with the blood an epistle, (<span class='it'>where</span> is not specified,
but we presume he indites it upon the bosom as
it is “close beside” the picture,) in which epistle he
announces that he is “another woman’s victim,”
giving us to understand that he himself is a woman
after all, and concluding with the delicious bit of
Billingsgate</p>

<p class='noindent'>We suppose, however, that “curse us” is a misprint;

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the narrative may be briefly
summed up. Waldron returns to his professional
engagements with the pirates, while Geraldine,
attended by her father, goes to sea for the benefit of
her health. The consequence is inevitable. The
vessels of the separated lovers meet and engage in
the most diabolical of conflicts. Both are blown all
to pieces. In a boat from one vessel, Waldron
escapes—in a boat from the other, the lady Geraldine.
Now, as a second natural consequence, the
parties meet again—Destiny is every thing in such
cases. Well, the parties meet again. The lady
Geraldine has “that miniature” about her neck, and
the circumstance proves too much for the excited
state of mind of Mr. Waldron. He just seizes her
ladyship, therefore, by the small of the waist and incontinently
leaps with her into the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However intolerably absurd this skeleton of the
story may appear, a thorough perusal will convince
the reader that the entire fabric is even more so. It
is impossible to convey, in any such digest as we
have given, a full idea of the <span class='it'>niaiseries</span> with which
the narrative abounds. An utter want of <span class='it'>keeping</span> is
especially manifest throughout. In the most solemnly
serious passages we have, for example, incidents of
the world of 1839, jumbled up with the distorted
mythology of the Greeks. Our conclusion of the
drama, as we just gave it, was perhaps ludicrous
enough; but how much more preposterous does it
appear in the grave language of the poet himself!</p>

<p class='line0'>He saw her, kissed her cheek, and wildly flung</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;His arms around her with a mad’ning throw⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Then plunged within the cold unfathomed deep</p>

<p class='noindent'>Only think of a group of <span class='it'>sirens</span> singing to sleep a

water with a New York dandy in tight pantaloons!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not even these stupidities would suffice to
justify a total condemnation of the poetry of Mr.
Dawes. We have known follies very similar committed
by men of real ability, and have been induced
to disregard them in earnest admiration of the brilliancy
of the minor beauty of <span class='it'>style</span>. Simplicity, perspicuity
and vigor, or a well-disciplined ornateness,
of language, have done wonders for the reputation
of many a writer really deficient in the higher and
more essential qualities of the Muse. But upon
these minor points of manner our poet has not even
the shadow of a shadow to sustain him. His works,
in this respect, may be regarded as a theatrical world
of mere verbiage, somewhat speciously bedizzened
with a tinselly meaning well adapted to the eyes of
the rabble. There is not a page of any thing that
he has written which will bear, for an instant, the
scrutiny of a critical eye. Exceedingly fond of the
glitter of metaphor, he has not the capacity to
manage it, and, in the awkward attempt, jumbles together
the most incongruous of ornament. Let us
take any passage of “Geraldine” by way of exemplification.</p>

his defiance (literally throwing his gauntlet or
glove) to the adverse breezes, dashing up rainbows
on his lee, laughing at them, and chasing them at the
same time, and, in conclusion, “sending back their

be pardoned (after the many specimens thus given at

particular selection) the <span class='it'>entireness</span> with which the

<p class='pindent'>Whatever shall be, hereafter, the position of Mr.
Dawes in the poetical world, he will be indebted for
it altogether to his shorter compositions, some of
which have the merit of tenderness; others of
melody and force. What seems to be the popular
opinion in respect to his more voluminous effusions,
has been brought about, in some measure, by a certain
general <span class='it'>tact</span>, nearly amounting to taste, and
more nearly the converse of talent. This tact has
been especially displayed in the choice of not inelegant
titles and other externals; in a peculiar imitative
speciousness of manner, pervading the surface
of his writings; and (here we have the anomaly of
a positive benefit deduced from a radical defect) in
an absolute deficiency in basis, in <span class='it'>stamen</span>, in matter,
or pungency, which, if even slightly evinced, might
have invited the reader to an intimate and understanding
perusal, whose result would have been disgust.
His poems have not been condemned, only
because they have never been read. The glitter
upon the surface has sufficed, with the newspaper
critic, to justify his hyperboles of praise. Very few
persons, we feel assured, have had sufficient nerve
to wade <span class='it'>through</span> the entire volume now in question,
except, as in our own case, with the single object of
criticism in view. Mr. Dawes has, also, been aided
to a poetical reputation by the amiability of his
character as a man. How efficient such causes have
before been in producing such effects, is a point but
too thoroughly understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have already spoken of the numerous <span class='it'>friends</span>
of the poet; and we shall not here insist upon the
fact, that <span class='it'>we</span> bear him no personal ill will. With
those who know us, such a declaration would appear
supererogatory; and by those who know us not, it
would, doubtless, be received with incredulity. What
we have said, however, is <span class='it'>not</span> in opposition to Mr.
Dawes, nor even so much in opposition to the poems
of Mr. Dawes, as in defence of the many true souls
which, in Mr. Dawes’ apotheosis, are aggrieved.
The laudation of the unworthy is to the worthy the
most bitter of all wrong. But it is unbecoming in
him who merely demonstrates a truth, to offer reason
or apology for the demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now if I did but possess the magic pencil of my
friend Doughty—his glorious power of dashing off a
landscape, with all the truthfulness of nature in the
outline—fresh and verdant, with shadows rendered
almost transparent from the light with which they
are so beautifully blended—mellow with that soft
hazy atmosphere which hangs forever about his
waterfalls, and slumbers along the green slopes
where they lie in the sunshine till the gazer becomes
almost drowsy as he admires.—If I had but his
pencil and his power, instead of this golden pen and
the one drop of ink which stains its point, never was
there a more lovely picture than I would paint for
your especial gratification. I would throw upon the
canvass my own birth-place, a quiet old-fashioned
village of Connecticut, one of the greenest and most
picturesque spots that human eye ever dwelt upon, or
that human ingenuity ever contrived to destroy.
But alas! Doughty’s genius can alone inspire his
pencil, and a rude <span class='it'>pen sketch</span> from memory is all
the idea that I can give you of “our village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine for a moment that we are standing on a
picturesque old bridge down in a valley, through
which a river of some considerable magnitude is
wending its way to a juncture with the Housatonic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are looking to the north—your hand rests on
the mouldering beams which form a side railing to
the bridge, and as your eye is lifted from the deep
waters at our feet, where they circle and whirl around
the dark and sodden supporters, it is caught by one of
the most beautiful waterfalls that ever cooled the
summer air with its spray. A little up the stream,
it foams and flashes over a solid ledge of rocks
like an army of laughing children romping together
and running races in the sunshine. Now and then
you catch a flash of prismatic color just beginning to
weave itself amid the water-drops that are forever
flashing up as if to provoke the sunshine into forming
a rainbow, and then your attention is drawn
away by the wreaths of snowy foam and the thousand
dimpling whirlpools that form beneath the fall and
melt idly upon the more quiet waters long before
they reach the dark shadow flung downward from
the bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is not that a magnificent bank stretching along the
river’s brink far above the fall?—here, looming up
in a broken mass of rocks—there, falling with a
gentle slope to the water’s brink, sometimes cut into
defiles and hollows by the rivulets that feed the brook,
and everywhere covered with the quivering green
of spring, the feathery red maple—wild-cherry
trees, white with spring blossoms, and whole thickets
of starry dog-wood flowers all tangled and luxuriating
between sun and water. With what majesty
the bank sweeps back at the fall, giving breadth to the
valley below and hedging in, with its green rampart,
this beautiful little plain with its fine grove which
lies on our left, nestled almost entirely within its
shadow! Now look down the stream. Follow the
bank as it curves inward again, encompassing the
rich surface of level ground in a semicircular sweep,
till it terminates down the stream yonder, in a pile
of rocks and foliage, half hill half mountain. There
the river joins it again—winds around the precipice
which forms its base, and is lost to sight, as if it
terminated amid the dense shadows which lie sleeping
there. Did you ever see anything more superb
than that lofty pile of rocks and verdure, standing
out over the very river, like a glorious old garrison
guarding the passage? Its topmost trees are lost in a
pile of fleecy clouds—the steep surface is burdened
with foliage, and beautifully broken up with lights
and shadows. See the sunshine flickering over those
massive rocks and kindling with its silvery light the
grape-vines that creep among the young trees, rooted
in the clefts. A picturesque feature, in our sketch, is
that old Castle-rock, and many a holiday have I
spent, with a troop of school-mates, amid its clefts,
piling up the rich mosses we found there, gathering
honey-suckle apples, and sometimes doing terrible
execution on the poor garter-snakes that crept harmlessly
from their nests to sleep in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn once more, and mark how, like a serpent
creeping through the thrifty herbage, the road leads,
from the bridge where we stand, across the level
ground and up the bank! See where it begins to curve
back from the fall, till it is lost amid the trees and
shrubbery which but half conceal that cluster of
white houses standing against the sky so far above us,
and looking so quiet and rural among the fresh trees.
Can any thing appear more religious than that white
church in their midst, rising from its bed of vegetation
and throwing the shadow of its taper steeple
aslant the graves that are gathered to the very brink
of the hill? How distinct are the white gravestones
and the long grass shivering among them! My
mother’s grave is there beneath the old oak standing
alone in that solitary graveyard. My playmates
never went with me there, but often have I lingered
beneath that old tree, listening to the music of its
restless leaves, and the rushing waters below me, till
aspirations awoke in my young heart, holy and deep
as ever the pride of my womanhood has known. At
nightfall I have wandered amid those graves—a little
child, and yet fearless—till the stars have stationed
themselves in the blue heavens above me, and the
fireflies have flashed their tiny brilliants among the
grass, like gentle spirits sent to light up the places
of the dead; and thoughts, for which I had no name,
would fill my heart with pleasant sadness till I went
away, reluctantly, amid feelings that haunted me at
night as I listened to the acorns rattling from the oak
trees over the roof of our house, and colored my
dreams long after the dash of the waterfall had lulled
me to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have wearied you, with my reminiscences, so you
have turned away from the houses on Fall’s-hill,
to those on the opposite bank, which we have
scarcely noticed yet. The hill which forms this side
of the valley, is neither so lofty nor picturesque as
the other. You will observe that the road branches
off at that end of the bridge—that the turnpike
which lends to the old Presbyterian meeting-house,
and the dwellings which surround it, is cut through
the bank some thirty feet down, but forms a steep
ascent to the most thickly settled portion of our
village. The roof of our old meeting-house—the
belfry of our new academy, with the third story
window blinds, all fresh and verdant with green
paint—half the front of a dry goods store, with the
gable end of a red farm-house, are all the signs
of life which we can obtain from our station on
the bridge—yet the most thrifty and industrious
portion of our village is located on School-hill.
The Episcopal church, and the white cottages opposite,
can boast more of rural beauty, perhaps; but
that old meeting-house has stood on School-hill
almost a century, and many of the farmers who
surround it have grown rich upon lands which they
inherited from men who worshiped beneath its
roof almost before the rafters were shingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now permit me to draw your attention to the little
plain at our left, in the river vale, between the two
portions of our village, lying green, and fresh, like a
garden run wild, and, but for one cottage house,
left to its own leafy solitude. A magnificent
grove of white pines stoops and murmurs to the
wind as it draws down the valley, the tufted boughs
give out a healthy odor, and in their shadows are a
thousand grassy nooks and hollows filled with wild
blossoms that give a richer fragrance to the air. I
have said there was but one house in the river vale.
A little back from the river’s brink, and just beyond
the clump of chesnuts at the end of the bridge, are
two large oak trees, sheltering, and almost hiding a
low cottage house. A flower garden is in front, and
a sweep of rich sward rolls from the back parlor
windows down to the water’s edge. It is a quiet
rural dwelling, and the home of my childhood. Does
it not look sequestered and deliciously cool? That
waterfall, which sounds a perpetual anthem night and
day, can be seen from the windows. The fine grove
forever spreads its sea of green in front, and here
are the old bridge, the village cut into fragments, and
the rough hills giving a dash of the sublime to what
is in itself so beautiful!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is yet another object which cannot be seen
from the bridge, but from our cottage door we may
trace the road which branches off from the turnpike
at the opposite end where it winds along the river’s
margin till it reaches a spot just opposite Castle-rock.
There the high bank crowds close down to the water,
thus forcing the projectors of the road to lead it up
the brow of the hill, where a growth of underwood
and some few trees that have been left standing partially
conceal its course, and the exact spot where
a cross road from School-hill intersects it. But
just at that point and directly opposite the highest
peak of Castle-rock, stood a handsome white dwelling-house,
with green blinds and a portico of lattice
work, covered half the year with crimson trumpet
flowers and cinnamon roses. In the winter, when
the trees were leafless, we had a full view of this
house from our cottage, and could almost distinguish
its inmates as they passed in and out through the
portico. Even in the summer, its white walls might
here and there be seen gleaming through the green
foliage, and very frequently the figures of two young
girls appeared at night-fall wandering through the
garden which sloped down the hill, where the flower
beds and thickets were at the twilight hour rendered
golden by the sun as he plunged over Castle-rock,
deluging it with a glory which kindled up the whole
landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This house was occupied by a widow, and the
two girls were her daughters. The homestead was
their joint property, with a small farm which lay
further up the hill. They might have had other
means of support, but I was too young at the time to
be informed on the subject; certain it is that possession,
or some other claim to standing which I could
not appreciate, gave a distinction to the family which
made the widow a sort of village aristocrat, a female
leader in the church, and one of those sanctimonious
domestic tyrants who profess to do every thing from
principle, and to consider those impulses and generous
feelings of the heart which are its brightest
waters, things to struggle with and pray against.
Her husband had been dead many years, and must
have been a man of some consequence in the village.
Her daughters were pleasant girls, one of them
decidedly handsome, but totally unlike both in person
and character. Phebe, the eldest, had always been
a gentle and quiet child, one of those retiring and
sensitive creatures whose whole being seems imbrued
with religion, naturally as flowers are with color and
perfume. When a mere child she became a member
of the old Presbyterian church on School-hill, and
this circumstance served to make her a favorite with
the mother, and to strengthen that most deceitful of all
passions, spiritual pride, in her heart. In the church
Mrs. Gray was feared and looked up to, for she was a
strong minded, intelligent woman, bland in tone and
smooth in manner, but in reality selfish in heart
and stubborn of purpose. With these qualities she
retained an influence among the brethren which
strength of intellect, without goodness of heart, will
often acquire over weaker minds, however pure
they be, even to a dangerous extent. If the mother
was feared and reverenced, little Phebe was loved
and petted like a flower among the members—old
and young, high and low—all looked with affection
on the lamb of their flock, and so she grew up among
them, perhaps the purest and sweetest creature that
ever bloomed in the bosom of a Christian church.
But Malina, the bright, romping, mischievous Malina,
with her sunny brown eyes, her rosy cheeks and
dimples that played about them like sunshine trembling
in the heart of a rose, there was little hope of
Malina—poor thing! The good old deacon shook
his head gravely when she was mentioned, and more
than once, when she had been observed in the
widow’s cushioned pew, peeping with a roguish
smile from under her gipsy hat, at some schoolmate
in the gallery, or smoothing the folds of her
muslin dress, and tying her pink sash into all sorts of
love knots during service, the clergyman had reproved
her with a look from the pulpit, a proceeding which
only frightened the dimples from her face and deluged
it with crimson for a moment, which impulse of
shame was soon followed by a saucy pout of the red
lips, a toss of the gipsy bonnet which made the roses
on its crown tremble, and perhaps a desperate jerk at
the sash which destroyed all the love knots and left the
ends crumpled in her lap, while her mother sat frowning
majestically all the time, and poor Phebe was doing
her best to hide the tears and blushes which her sister’s
disgrace had occasioned. Still, though Malina was
a romp and a sad reprobate in the estimation of a
sect which had made old Connecticut celebrated
among the states by the strictness and sobriety of
their lives, there was something about the girl which
stole even upon their austere habits—a warmth of
heart and generosity of feeling that no faults could
check or conceal. She had a winning, soft and exceedingly
arch manner peculiarly her own, which
few could resist; a ready wit, and a laugh that rang
through the heart like the tones of a silver bell, and
which made the old deacon smile, even while he
was lecturing her. Before Malina was eighteen she
had good cause to congratulate herself that she was
not a “church member,” for most assuredly would
she have been ignominiously expelled had this been
the case. At that season a sectarian feud had arisen
between the Episcopal church and our old meeting-house,
a difference of opinion which went well nigh
to destroy all social intercourse in our village. The
Episcopalians had offered a practical reproof to the
upright manner in which the Presbyterians were in
the habit of addressing the throne of grace, by erecting
kneeling boards in the pews of their church, a
course which led our minister into open denunciation
of such heresy from the pulpit, where he eloquently
defended his own manner of worship by a sermon
containing manifold heads, and a prayer which was
responded to by a congregation more resolutely upright
both in body and mind than ever. This sermon
of course was answered from the white church, with
some spirit, and, in the midst of the controversy
which arose, Malina Gray took it into her pretty
head to exhibit a fashionable bonnet which she had
purchased in New Haven, and a smart silk dress, in
the Episcopal church, not only without asking her
mother’s consent, but directly against her known
wishes. It was even rumored that she did not rise,
but absolutely bent forward and covered her pretty
face with her pocket handkerchief, during the whole
time of prayer, and that, on leaving the church, three
persons had heard her say that she was delighted
with the sermon, and particularly with the chant, it
was <span class='it'>so</span> droll. It was in vain that Malina defended
her conduct, in vain she insisted that she had bent
forward, and used her handkerchief only to conceal
the motion of her lips as she ate half a dozen peppermint
drops, and a head of green fennel which a
companion had given her. She could not disprove
her presence at the church, and that alone was considered
as rank rebellion against her mother, and an
insult to the congregation with which she had been
taught to worship. Dark were the looks, and
manifold the lectures which poor Malina was compelled
to endure after this. When she entered the
old meeting-house on the following sabbath every
one looked coldly upon her. The minister even
hinted at her delinquency in his prayers, and, during
the sermon, two or three passages were applied
directly to herself, by the steady and reproving
glance which he fixed upon her from the pulpit.
Now Malina was not of a temperament to bear all
this patiently. She believed it intended to annoy and
humble her. So, instead of receiving the chastisement
with becoming humility, she arose from her
seat, opened the pew door, in spite of her mother’s
detaining hand, and hurried down the aisle, her eyes
sparkling with tears, and her cheeks crimsoned with
a degree of excitement which ill became the house
of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be perfectly aware of the enormity of Malina’s
conduct, our reader must bring to mind the discipline
of the times, and the rigid decorum exacted by the
people in their places of worship, where nothing
short of a fainting fit or a dispensation of apoplexy
could excuse the interruption of a sermon. Never
was a body of people so overwhelmed with astonishment
and dismay. The widow arose from her seat
pale with resentment, for it was by her private request
that the minister had pointed out the spirited
girl as a transgressor before the congregation—she
half opened the pew door, paused a moment and sat
down again, with her lips firmly compressed, and a
spirit burning in her dark eyes, which in another
might have been thought as much to be condemned
as that of her child. Phebe, the mild and gentle
Phebe, blushed crimson with a feeling of sympathy
for her sister, which could not, with all her meekness
of disposition, be entirely suppressed. When the
glow died away from her cheeks she was in tears
and wept silently till the service closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Gray reached home that afternoon,
sternly ruminating on the best means of conquering
the refractory spirit of her child, she found the house
locked, and the rooms empty as she had left them.
Malina was no where to be found. It was in vain
that Phebe searched for the culprit. She went to
their mutual sleeping-chamber, hoping to find her
there, but all was silent. She lifted the muslin drapery
that fell over the bed like a summer cloud, put
her hand through the open sash and parting the thick
green leaves of a cinnamon rose tree that half darkened
it, looked anxiously up and down the road, and
along the footpath which threaded the river’s brink.
But the waters gliding quietly by, and a fish-hawk
soaring up from the shore just below the bridge, with
an unfortunate perch in his claws, alone rewarded
her gaze. Still she leaned from the window, apprehensive
on her sister’s account, but afraid to extend
her search beyond the house, for never in the whole
course of her life had Mrs. Gray permitted her children
to walk even in the garden on a sabbath day;
a walk to and from the old meeting-house morning
and evening was all the exercise that she had allowed
them. Phebe felt as if almost transgressing a domestic
rule even while she lingered with her head
out of the window, and when the chamber door
opened she started back like a guilty thing, and with
a violence that sent a shower of pink leaves half
over the room, from the full blown roses which fell
rustling together from her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray entered the chamber quietly, but a little
paler than usual, and with her lips still slightly compressed.
She evidently expected to find the culprit
there, but when she saw only her elder daughter
standing by the window, in tears and with a look of
trouble on her sweet face, her own composure seemed
a little shaken, still she did not speak, but going up
to the toilet took a pocket bible from its snowy cover,
and dusting away the rose leaves that had fallen
there with her handkerchief, was about to leave the
room again. As she passed through the door, Phebe
found courage to follow her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother,” she said, “what can have become
of her? Where can she be? Let me go and look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the sabbath,” said Mrs. Gray, in her usual
slow, mild voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is, mother,” replied the weeping girl,
“but when a lamb strays from the flock can there
be wrong in bringing it home again, even on the
sabbath?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may search for your sister in the garden,”
was the reply, “and when she is found bring her to
the parlor. Our minister will be there, and if she
does not beg his pardon for her flagrant conduct, even
on her knees if he desires it, she is henceforth no
child of mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother, do not urge her to-night. You know
how high spirited and resolute she is—and, indeed,
indeed, I must think they have been too hard with
her—it was cruel to expose her fault before the whole
village, her schoolmates and all, and she so proud
and sensitive. I wonder it didn’t kill her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you also become rebellious?” said Mrs.
Gray, turning her eyes with steady disapproval on
the agitated girl, and marveling within herself at the
burst of feeling which she evinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will never, I trust, find me rebellious,” replied
Phebe meekly, but weeping all the time. “I
know that Malina has faults; who has not? but they
are such as harsh treatment will perpetuate, not conquer.
She is so kind, so warm-hearted, that you can
persuade her to any thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not choose to <span class='it'>persuade</span> my children,” said
the mother, moving forward. “Go seek Malina in
the garden, and bring her to me as I desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I fear that she is not in the garden,” said
Phebe, doubtingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then seek her elsewhere, but return soon,” was
Mrs. Gray’s reply, and she went down stairs just as
Phebe heard the minister knocking at the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe tied on her cottage bonnet, and flinging a
scarf over her white dress went into the garden. She
traversed the flower-beds, searched among the rose
thickets, and the lilac trees, calling Malina by
name, but all without effect. More than once, when
a rustling among the bushes, created by a tame rabbit,
reached her ear, she started and listened with an expectation
that her call would be answered. After
searching through the garden and around the rock
spring—a fountain of water that leaped through a
hollow at the foot of the hill into a natural basin of
solid granite—we saw her come out into the road and
look anxiously toward the pine grove on our side of
the river, with her hand shading her eyes and her
scarf fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As our cottage stood on neutral ground, between
the two sections of the village, so our family was perhaps
the only one within three miles which did not
take part in the religious controversy going on. It
was our usual custom to worship in the old meeting-house
in the morning, and in the afternoon attend
service in the Episcopal church. This habit left us
ignorant of what had been passing on School-hill,
and when we saw Phebe Gray out in the open street
that sabbath evening, we felt that something unusual
must have occurred. She remained, as I have described,
with a hand shading her eyes for more than
a minute, and then hurried down the road toward the
bridge at a quicker pace than we had ever seen her
walk before. After crossing the bridge, she paused
a moment on seeing our family sitting at the door—some
of us on the steps and others reading on the
greensward in which they were bedded—as if
prompted to come toward us, but changing her mind
she followed the road a few steps and then turned
into the pine grove, through a footpath which led
along that portion which skirted the river. After a
little time she came in sight again, retracing her
steps with another person whom we recognized as
Malina. Their progress was very slow, Phebe’s
arm was around her sister’s waist, and she seemed
to be talking with great earnestness. When they
came opposite our house we could see Malina’s
face, though after the first glance toward us she
turned it away, as if ashamed of the tears which
stained her cheeks. Her dress was disordered and
a little soiled by the moss on which she had evidently
flung herself; her gipsy hat was blown on one
side, exposing a profusion of brown ringlets slightly
disheveled, and out of curl enough to make them
fall more profusely than usual over her neck and
shoulders. She walked with an impatient step, and
seemed a little restless under the restraint of her sister’s
arm, but when they got within the shadow of
the chesnuts, and as they supposed beyond our observation,
we saw her pause all of a sudden, fling
her arms round Phebe’s neck and kiss her more than
once with a degree of affection which spoke volumes
in her favor. After this she arranged the hat on her
head with considerable care and allowed the folds of
her disordered dress to be smoothed. Then with
another kiss the two girls crossed the bridge, each
with her arm circling the other, and in this position
they walked up the hill and disappeared in the portico
of their own dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls entered the family parlor; Malina
with her cheek flushed once more and a step tremulous
but haughty. Poor Phebe clung to her side,
looking frightened and much more like a culprit than
her sister. Mrs. Gray was seated at a table looking
cold, precise and courteous as if nothing had happened;
her black silk dress was arranged with that
scrupulous care which she always bestowed on her
raiment. Her false curls were carefully fastened beneath
the slate-colored ribands and the fine lace
border of her cap, while a muslin neckerchief was
folded on her bosom, beneath the dress, sufficiently
low to reveal a neck that had not yet lost all its
whiteness, and a string of large gold beads which
encircled it. The family bible lay open before her,
but she was not reading, for in an easy chair close
by sat the minister. He had been pastor at School-hill
for more than twenty years, was naturally a
kind man, but believed the well-being of his congregation
to be identified with certain doctrinal points,
which to dispute was rank heresy. He looked very
grave when the girls entered, and rather restless, as
if the duty which brought him there was one which
his naturally kind heart would have avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phebe, you may go to your chamber,” said Mrs.
Gray to her eldest daughter, who had followed Malina
to a chintz sofa and was about to sit down by her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe hesitated and looked toward her mother, as
if anxious to remain; but as she parted her lips to
speak, a more decided command sent her weeping
from the room.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>JEREMY SHORT AMONG THE RHODE ISLANDERS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, sirs, Robin is a gallant poney, but riding
over these confounded hills has almost shaken me
to pieces, and, at every stride, for the last ten
minutes, I’ve heard my bones rattling like pennies
in a beggar’s alms-box. My mouth’s as parched
as if dried up by lightning—but be sociable, lads,
and give us a drinking cup, if it’s no better than
a clam shell. Ah! that’s divine, better than ambrosia,
real Cogniac I declare. How are you, captain?
doctor? general?—bless my soul! if yonder
isn’t Providence. Egad! this is a delightful place—beats
Rowseville all hollow—it only wants a few
trees here, and a clump of woodland there, to make
it as cool and shady as a Mussulman’s paradise.
The bay is alive with craft, and yonder—just look at
them—are two jaunty rascals racing. How the little
fellow eats to windward—they are throwing ballast
overboard from the larger craft—whizz, whizz, one
can almost hear the water bubbling along the wash-board
as she bends to the blast—and now, side by
side, they go, the foam crackling over the bow, and
drenching the crew all the way aft. Huzza! the
little fellow has won, and dances into the wind as
Taglioni when she springs on the stage, more like a
spirit than a human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They’re opening the bake—are they? Then I’ll
take a seat by the heap here, with your leave, sir,
and go to work. Heaven bless the Indians for having
taught us how to cook clams! Yes, there’s all the
difference in the world between eating your clam at
a table, and eating it hot and smoking from the heap.
I’d as lief think of turning Grahamite, and going
through a purgatory of bran bread and water, as
give up a seat at the bake. It’s there you get a clam
in all its glory; in its spirituality, I may say—egad!
it’s as sweet as a kiss from a blushing angel of sixteen.
The heap, sir! why it’s an earthly paradise—the
το χχλον of existence—the all in all of the epicure.
Ah! the perfume of that steam is delicious—just see
how poetically the vapor curls away into the air, for
all the world like the morning mists rolling upward
in the Catskill valley—you’ve been at the mountain
house, no doubt. And then the clams themselves!
Clams! egad, they are food for immortals! Isn’t
this a superb fellow?—how snowy his shell—how
perfect his form—how savory his juice—how rich
his color—how luscious his taste:—by the gods! if
Apicius were here, he’d dance a saraband, or snap
his fingers through a cachuca, in sheer ecstasy at
having found a dish that would have made jubilee on
Olympus. Hip, hip, hurrah! haven’t I caught a
jewel of a fellow? None of your rascally quohogs,
but the real Narragansett clam for me. The poor,
deluded wretches on the Jersey shore, who think
their round-shells are clams, and chew for half an
hour at what isn’t better than sole leather, have no
more idea of what a real clam is, than a Hottentot
of Heaven, or—what is the same thing—a crusty
old bachelor of matrimony. The man who never
ate a Narragansett clam can’t expect to live long,
or die happy; he may dwindle out a miserable existence,
but—take my word for it—he is a poor devil
after all, no better than the horse in the mill, going
the same eternal round, and living on salt hay and
stagnant water. Heaven have mercy on the souls
of such wretches! Ah! that’s a good fellow, stir
up the heap; and here’s as juicy a villain as ever
roasted, tall and slender, “in linked sweetness long
drawn out.” Another and another—I shall faint
with ecstasy, and must really take a little to calm
my transports. Chowder may be fine, turtle soup
glorious, tautog a dish for kings, but clams! clams!!
sirs, would almost raise the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thank you for drinking my health, gentlemen—you
ask me whether we have any such thing as a
clam-bake in Philadelphia—bless my soul! if we
had, it wouldn’t be such a place for riots, broken
banks, and all sorts of other eccentricities. Starvation
was the cause of the French Revolution—to the
fogs of England can be traced the suicides there—and
it’s my candid belief that the absence of clam-bakes
whereat to recreate is the prime origin of the
present difficulties. Don’t ask me to demonstrate
my position, for I hate logic as I hate olives and
old maids. Assertion, sirs, is everything—a neat,
portable affair that unrolls in a moment, and can’t be
turned into a dozen aspects like shot silk. No, no,
if a man ain’t convinced by a round assertion call
him a fool, and if he resents it knock him down.
There’s more evil come upon the world from the
habit of reasoning than a thousand penitents, walking
around the globe with pebbles in their shoes, could
redeem. If two friends disagree, what is the cause?
Argument. If a man quarrels with his wife, it’s because
he stopped to reason with her. Bow deprecatingly,
though with suavity, in the first case: kiss
your wife and call her angel in the second case—and
you keep your friend and helpmate; but get into
an argument, and you are booked for a maelstrom
from which St. Peter couldn’t save you. The Transcendentalists
understand this matter: <span class='it'>they</span> never
argue. They lay down something which they themselves
can’t understand, and then call on the gaping
disciple to give credence to it: if they are believed,
it is well; if not, they jabber a jargon of shibboleth,
call him a world-deluded gull, and turn away talking
of the light within, and the glories of Pantheism.
And so with the ladies, dear creatures, whom Nature
intends for peace-makers, and, therefore, never
allows them to give any better reason for what they
do than “because”—thereby saving them a world of
trouble about major and minor premises, and other
things “in concatenation accordingly.” Glory be
to the man who first invented assertion!—may the
author of logic go to thunder, whence he came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young folks, further south, have, it is true, a
sort of penance they call a pic-nic; but a pic-nic is
no more like a clam-bake than vinegar is like champaigne.
Imagine a dozen couple packed into an
omnibus, after having got up before day—a thing no
sane man was ever known to do—jolting over dusty
roads for an hour or two, and then sitting down on
the damp grass, on a greenish rock, or on a decaying
trunk, to breakfast on cold ham and insipid water.
Call you that fun? And, by and bye, the sentimental
ones will wander off into the woods to read Tom
Moore in company or alone—while those who affect
field sports, Heaven save the mark! will go bobbing
for eels with a skewer, or fish for trout in still waters
and with a float. Others may rig out a rickety, leaky
scow, shaded by an awning not bigger than a sun-screen,
and take a sail—the gentlemen shoving the
ark along with poles, and the ladies, all dressed in
white, sitting with their feet in the water and singing
“The Gondolier’s Song,” or “Shall we go a sailing!”
Then, at noon, when the sun is hot enough to broil a
steak, and the sweet dears’ faces look as flushed as a
cook’s, they will huddle around a table cloth spread
on the dusty grass, and try to keep each other in
countenance by eating the remnants of their breakfast,
washing the whole down with the interminable
water, or lemonade so sour that a cupful would carry
off a regiment with the cholera. Toward night they
will start for home, regarding it as “a crowning
mercy,” as old Noll would say, if a thunder storm
doesn’t come up, and drench them through. Egad!
it would make the tears run down your cheeks with
laughter, if you could only see a pic-nic party after a
shower—all draggled and dirty, dripping like drowned
rats, or, to be more complimentary, like mermaids,
hungry, tired, out of humor, and looking as unlike
the dear angels we love as a radish looks unlike a
claret bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never see a young man going on a pic-nic,
but I ask if insanity doesn’t run in his family. But
a clam-bake, sirs, is a different affair. On the
hard, smooth, white sand of the bay shore you pitch
your tent, for music having the low voice of the ripples
as they break on the beach, the fresh breeze the
while crisping the waves into silver, and fanning
you with a delicious coolness that reminds you of the
airs of that Eden you used to dream of when a child.
It is not long before you have mustered a gay fishing
party, and pushing from the shore, you row out by
the well known stake, throw overboard the keelog,
and idly rocking on the low, long swell, spend an
hour, or it may be two, in the most delicious of pastimes.
And when you tire of the sport, you lean
lazily over the gunwale, and gaze far down into the
transparent wave, where the fish float to and fro, the
long grass waves with the tide, or the snowy bottom
sparkles fitfully in the sun. Long ere noon has come
your craft is laden with the spoil, and then it is “up
keelog and away!” A few rapid, rollicking strokes
bring you to the shore—your boat grates musically
on the hard sand—and a joyous shout welcomes you
back, while all hurry to inspect your cargo and wonder
at your skill. By this time the table, spread by
fair hands, is ready—and now the bake begins! A
half hour, and lo! dinner is ready to be served—just
at the very nick of time, too, for the sun is now at
meridian, and the bay glitters like molten silver,
while far and near the atmosphere boils in the sultry
beams. Retreating to the shade of the tent—made
more cool by a copious sprinkling of water—you are
soon deep in the mysteries of clams, and sweet corn
and, what would make a god’s mouth water, tautog
baked in the heap. Pop—pop go the corks of the
champaigne flasks, and here, cool as the peaks of
Mont Blanc, comes the foaming liquid, sparkling
and bright as the wit of a Sheridan, egad! And
thus ends the dinner; but think not it stops here.
All day long you see bright faces and hear gay laughter;
and when evening steals on, and the moon rises
in the azure sky, trailing a fairy line of light across
the waters, and flooding the snowy beach with her
effulgence—when the night wind murmurs among
the trees, or sighs over the sleeping bay—when the
jocund music strikes up and you dance merrily on
the hard white sand, while bright eyes sparkle and
fair cheeks flush with love—then you have a foretaste
of heaven, and wish to lie down and sleep, and,
sleeping, dream of such delicious pastime. And, by
and bye, when returning home, the air is vocal with
songs, warbled by the seraphic voices of those you
love—and, as you dash through the trees, the moon,
all the while shimmering between the leaves, you
almost shout aloud in the exhilaration of the moment.
Gradually, however, you sink into a more pensive
mood, and silence falls on you and the white-armed
one beside you, so that, at length, you may hear
nothing but a gentle (yet oh! how eloquent) sigh, and
the low beating of her heart, audible in the stillness.
Aye! and if you look into her eyes you will see
there a music more soul-subduing than the softest
strains. At length your hands will meet, and with a
strange, delicious thrill through your whole frame,
she will sink yielding on your bosom, and then—and
then, God bless me! I’ve been thinking of the way
I used to make love, and forgot all about the clam-bake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the heap’s empty and the bottle drained I’ll stop,
but since you all beg for it, I’ll give you, some of
these days, my notions on <span class='sc'>making love</span>, egad! And
now here’s Robin—hip, ho, we’re off.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Critical and Miscellaneous Writings of Thomas Noon
Talfourd, author of “Ion,” etc. In one volume. Philadelphia,
Carey &amp; Hart, 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is doubted by many intelligent critics whether the
present age has in very deed given birth to any work of
genius which will withstand the restless beatings of the
waves of time and carry down to remotest generations the
embodied evidence of the power and greatness of the Nineteenth
Century. There is certainly room for an honest difference
of opinion on this point, for it cannot be denied that
on looking around the eye meets not at every corner nor
does the ear hear, acting or uttering their Life Poem from
every house-top, <span class='sc'>Homers</span>, <span class='sc'>Shakspeares</span>, <span class='sc'>Luthers</span>, or
<span class='sc'>Miltons</span>. But that our cotemporaries are eminently skilled
in examining into and discovering the worth of what has
been done aforetime cannot be denied. Criticism has been
made an <span class='sc'>art</span>; and there is an evident tendency to exalt
the man, with his telescope, to the star he looks at. We
do not at present intend to find fault with this disposition,
nor should we have mentioned it, but for the purpose of
saying that it has produced some not distasteful fruits,
among the best of which we rank these critical essays of
Mr. Sergeant <span class='sc'>Talfourd</span>. We are glad they have been
thus collected together, for the periodicals in which they first
appeared reach but few of those who would fain read them.
<span class='sc'>Macauley</span> and <span class='sc'>Carlyle</span> write mainly for one or two works,
so that with comparatively little difficulty the general reader
may find all their productions; but Mr. <span class='sc'>Talfourd</span> writes
for quarterlies, monthlies and weeklies, and a collective re-publication
of his contributions was therefore greatly to be
desired. He makes admirable speeches, too, on copyright,
and in defence of the professors of high Art when they are
assailed by the spirit of the world, or when, in their vagaries,
not always the most orderly, they run athwart some of
the good and unbending rules established for the general
welfare. These, we are sorry to say, we do not find in
the present volume. Still, we are too thankful for what
we have, to complain of the absence of the defence of Shelley
and the argument on the rights of authors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peculiar characteristics of Mr. <span class='sc'>Talfourd’s</span> criticism
are its catholic liberality, its accurate and clear sighted discrimination,
its insight, which is really of the <span class='it'>scientific</span> kind,
and its classical purity, both in thought and style. He
never writes hastily or without elaboration, and yet his
criticism is not cold and unsympathizing. He enters deeply
into the spirit of the work he examines, is peculiarly sensitive
to its beauties and excellencies, and speaks of them
eloquently and with boldness. His language is strong, but
polished, and there is always in his thought a cheerful confidence
and a keen-eyed discernment, which instruct and
strengthen. The essay on <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span> is among the best
in the volume, written in the spirit of the poetry it dissects,
and evincing skill in developing beauty, and a sharp sense
which will detect it wherever it exists. The review of
Wallace’s Prospects of Mankind, and the paper on Modern
Improvements, are valuable and instructive. The essays
on the profession of the law, and on pulpit oratory, are also
excellent. Indeed, the contents of this volume are so
uniformly good and so alike in all their prominent characteristics,
that it would be difficult, as it is certainly
unnecessary, to point out any as pre-eminently deserving
of applause.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Critical and Miscellaneous Writings of Sir Walter Scott.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a>
Collected by Himself. Now for the first time Published in
America. Three volumes, 12mo. Philadelphia, Carey &amp;

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Wizard of the North, as it was the custom a few
years ago to call <span class='sc'>Walter Scott</span>, may be regarded in four
aspects—as a novelist, a poet, a critic, and a historian. In
the first character he was unequaled, in the second and
third among the first of his age and country, and in the last,
alone, utterly contemptible; and that not for lack of ability
or painstaking, certainly, but on account of his perfect
recklessness of all principle, truth or decency that did not
tend to fill his pockets with money or advance the interests
of his party. In the volumes before us we have his
criticisms and miscellaneous essays, and though we had
aforetime been accustomed to regard them as possessing
comparatively slight merit, a reperusal of the greater number
has left on our mind an impression in the highest degree
favorable to them, as compared with the best productions
of their kind. <span class='sc'>Macauley</span> is our favorite reviewer; <span class='sc'>Wilson</span>,
<span class='sc'>Sidney Smith</span>, <span class='sc'>Talfourd</span> and <span class='sc'>Scott</span> we rank next.
With all his apparent rapidity and ease, <span class='sc'>Macauley</span> is the
most laborious of the fraternity. He spends his month in
reading—<span class='it'>cramming</span> is the technical phrase—everything
relating to his subject; sits for a week or two at his desk,
writing, recurring to documents, and rewriting, until
every fact or idea he deems worthy of retention is embodied
in his article, which is then carefully retouched and copied
for the “Edinburgh.” <span class='sc'>Talfourd</span> meditates his subject,
too, and polishes with no less care or skill. But <span class='sc'>Scott</span>
glanced upon the surface of things, skimmed over the abstracts
and summaries relating to his theme, and wrote off,
in his smooth, vivacious, pleasant way, his paper—read the
MS—marked in a few commas and colons—and sent it to
the printer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With too little time and space for an elaborate review of
these volumes, yet anxious, as in all our notices of books,
to give the reader a definite idea of their character, we place
in the margin a list of their contents, and shall notice more
particularly but a small number of the forty-eight articles of
which they are composed. The essays on <span class='sc'>Chatterton</span>
and <span class='sc'>Burns</span>, in the first volume, are sympathizing, liberal
and judicious, though less distinguished for nicety of discrimination
than some others on the same subjects. In the
second volume is his review of his own “Tales of My
Landlord,” from the <span class='it'>Quarterly</span>, for January, 1817, educed
by a series of essays from the pen of Doctor <span class='sc'>McCrie</span>, in
which the views given of the Scottish covenanters in the
Waverly novels were bitterly impugned. The authorship of
these novels, it will be remembered, was then a secret.
The modesty of Scott’s estimate of himself may be inferred
from the following passage, from page 144:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The volume which this author has studied is the great
book of nature. He has gone abroad into the world in
quest of what the world will certainly and abundantly
supply, but what a man of great discrimination alone will
find, and a man of the very highest genius will alone depict
after he has discovered it. The characters of Shakspeare
are not more exclusively human, not more perfectly men
and women as they live and move, than those of this
mysterious author.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, this <span class='it'>is</span> modest, compared with numerous other puffs
of himself from his own pen, written in his long and successful
career, and justified on the ground that they were
“fair business transactions.” Washington Irving has done
the same thing, in writing laudatory notices of his own
works for the reviews, and, like Scott, received pay for
whitewashing himself. We do not imagine that in either
case there was any great injustice in the self-praise, but
certainly Mr. Murray should not have been solicited to pay
the “guinea a page.” The articles in the third volume on
Kemble, Kelly’s Reminiscences, and Davy’s “Salmonia,”
are all excellent, and equally so. We have understood,
too, that the Letters from Malachi Malagrowther, Esquire,
on the currency, are readable, but we never look into articles
on such subjects.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The History of the Reformation of the Church of England,
by Gilbert Burnet, D. D., late Lord Bishop of Salisbury,
with the Collection of Records and a copious Index, revised
and corrected, with additional Notes and a Preface,
by the Rev. E. Nares, D. D., late Professor of Modern
History in the University of Oxford. Illustrated with a
Frontispiece and twenty-three engraved Portraits. Four
volumes, 8vo. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Burnet’s celebrated History of the Reformation in
England is one of those standard works which a gentleman
is ashamed not to have read. Respecting the important
period to which it relates, there are few productions so
frequently consulted by more modern writers, and its intrinsic
excellence must ever make it desirable, not only to
scholars and persons familiar with the advancement of civil
and ecclesiastical affairs, but to young students in history
and general readers. Of the ability of Doctor Nares, we
confess we have not a very high opinion—having, it may
be, imbibed some prejudices against him from Macauley—but,
as the English critics all concur, so far as we have
seen, in the opinion that his edition of this work is the best
extant, we are bound to believe that he has, in one instance,
done his duty well. If the work has any defects they are
such as we are unable to detect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnet’s History of the Reformation, though frequently
republished in England, has never before been printed in
America, and the high price of the English impressions here
kept it from the libraries of many who will now obtain
it. The copy before us is creditable to the publishers,
in all but the portraits, which, with deference to the taste
of Messrs. Appleton, we think add very little to its value or
beauty.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Cottage Residences; or a Series of Designs for Rural
Cottages and Cottage Villas and their Gardens and
Grounds, adapted to North America. By A. J. Downing.
Illustrated by numerous Engravings. One volume, 8vo.
New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Downing’s</span> previous publication, on Landscape
Gardening, has made or should have made his name
familiar to all for whom rural life has charms. This new
book, on a cognate subject, the application of moderate
means to country residences, is, like that, eminently calculated
to advance among us elegance, comfort, in a word,
<span class='it'>civilization</span>; and we hope, therefore, that it will be universally
studied. Mr. Downing’s object is to inspire the
minds of his readers with a vivid perception of the <span class='sc'>beautiful</span>
in every thing that relates to our houses and grounds—to
awaken a quicker sense of the grace or picturesqueness of
fine forms that may be produced in these by rural architecture
and ornamental gardening—a sense which will not
only refine and elevate the mind, but pour into it new and
infinite resources of delight. In his preface he remarks
that he wishes to imbue all persons with a love of beautiful
forms and a desire to assemble them around their daily
walks of life; to appreciate how superior is the charm of
that home where we discover the tasteful cottage or villa,
and the well designed and neatly kept garden or grounds,
full of beauty and harmony—not the less beautiful and
harmonious because simple and limited—and to become
aware that these superior forms, and the higher and more
refined enjoyment derived from them, may be had at the
same cost and the same labor as a clumsy dwelling, and its
uncouth and ill-designed accessories. “More than all,”
he continues, “I desire to see these sentiments cherished
for their pure and moral tendency. ‘All <span class='sc'>beauty</span> is an outward
expression of inward good,’ and so closely are the
Beautiful and True allied, that we shall find, if we become
sincere lovers of the grace, the harmony, and the
loveliness, with which rural homes and rural life are capable
of being invested, that we are silently opening our
hearts to an influence which is higher and deeper than the
mere <span class='it'>symbol</span>; and that if we have worshiped in the true
spirit, we shall have caught a nearer glimpse of the Great
Master whose words, in all his material universe, are
written in lines of Beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole volume, throughout, bears witness of the
cultivated intellect from which it sprung, and of the author’s
fine taste and enthusiastic appreciation of the attractions of
a country life. It is printed and embellished as such a
work should be. We heartily commend it to the attention
of country gentlemen.</p>

John Dunlap. Two volumes, 12mo. Philadelphia,
Carey &amp; Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the recent summer there has been republished in
this country no book for the library more interesting or
valuable than this History of Fiction. It was first printed
at Edinburgh in 1814, and two years after a second and
much improved edition appeared in the same city, of which
this by Messrs. Carey &amp; Hart is a reproduction. The
History of Fiction is intimately connected with the history
of the advancement of society, and is therefore interesting
to the philosopher as well as the man of letters. Mr.
Dunlap traces separately the progress of the romances of
chivalry, the Italian tales, the spiritual romance, the pastoral
stories, the French novels, the modern English novels and
romances, etc., and gives analysis—so far as our very limited
acquaintance with them enables us to judge, correct and
sufficiently full to convey a just idea of their character and
merit—of the early and rare productions which form the
landmarks of his subject. Our own impressions do not on
all points correspond with those of Mr. Dunlap; and we
think he erred in confining his History to <span class='it'>prose</span> fictions only,
as the creations of the poets, though earlier and in all ways
superior, resemble them too nearly in their chief characteristics
to be regarded separately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a lively and entertaining journal of a professional

<p class='pindent'>The new volume of the Gift surpasses in the style of its
typography and the merit of its pictorial embellishments
any annual ever published in this country; and its literary
contents will not suffer by comparison with those of any
work, American or foreign, of the same description. To
prove the correctness of this opinion we have only to remark
that all the writers—save one or two of an indifferent
stamp of whom we never heard before—are contributors
to this magazine. The picture from Huntington—miscalled
“Mercy’s <span class='it'>Dream</span>"—is one of the most exquisite productions
in its way with which we are acquainted; “The News-Boy,”
from Inman, represents the class which it is designed
to portray to the life; and the head from Malbone shows
that the high reputation of that artist was not undeserved.
The picture from Chapman we cannot praise—a head of
eight on a body of eighteen is in bad taste, to say the least
of it. The best prose papers in the volume are those by
Mrs. “Mary Clavers,” Mr. Smith, Mr. Herbert and Mr.

<p class='pindent'>The puritan settlers of New England, while carrying on
war against the Indian tribes, deemed it right to spend the
hours their enemies devoted to profane dances and incantations,
in singing verses, half military and half religious; and
their actions in the field were celebrated in ballads which
lacked none of the spirit and fidelity of the songs of the old
bards and scalds, however deficient they may have been
in metrical array and sentiment. “Lovewell’s Fight,”
“The Gallant Church,” “Smith’s Affair at Sidelong Hill,”
and “The Godless French Soldier,” are among the best
lyrical compositions of the early period in which they were
written, and are not without value as historical records.
At the commencement of the Revolution, <span class='sc'>Barlow</span>, <span class='sc'>Trumbull</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dwight</span>, <span class='sc'>Humphreys</span>, and other “Connecticut
wits,” employed their leisure in writing patriotic songs
for the soldiers and the people, “which,” says a life of
Putnam, “had great effect through the country.” “I do
not know,” wrote Barlow on entering the army, “whether
I shall do more for the cause in the capacity of chaplain
than I could in that of poet; I have great faith in the influence
of songs; and I shall continue, while fulfilling the
duties of my appointment, to write one now and then, and
to encourage the taste for them which I find in the camp.
One good song is worth a dozen addresses or proclamations.”
The great song-writer of the Revolution, however,
was <span class='sc'>Freneau</span>, whose pieces were everywhere sung
with enthusiasm. He was a keen satirist, and wrote with
remarkable facility; but his lyrics were often profane and
vulgar, while those written in New England, on account
of their style and cast of thought, were stigmatized by the
celebrated Parson <span class='sc'>Peters</span> as “psalms and hymns adapted
to the tastes of Yankee rebels.” The following is a characteristic

<p class='pindent'>We have not room to copy, <span class='it'>in extenso</span>, more of those
songs which served no less than the most eloquent orations
of the time to kindle the patriotic enthusiasm of our fathers,
in the first years of the struggle for independence; and
after giving specimen verses of one or two others, will
pass to the more strictly historical ballads. We may as
well here remark that the orthography and rhythmical construction
of many of the old songs and ballads varies in the
different editions—the earliest usually being most correct—and
that we have copied from the least inharmonious and
corrupt, sometimes giving one verse from one and another
verse from another impression of the same production. The
following stanzas are from “The Rallying Song,” written
soon after the friendly disposition of the government of the
unfortunate Louis XIV. was made known in this country.</p>

apparently, in the early part of the contest, we have space
for the chorus only. Though less poetical than some others,
the entire production is animated in sentiment and smoothly
versified. We have no clue to its authorship, though, like
“The Rallying Song,” “The American Rifleman,” and
many other lyrics of the same description, it appears to
have been written in Vermont.</p>

following, as one of the most curious of its class, and because,
like several others in this collection, it has never
before been printed. It was written by the surgeon of the
“Fair American,” and was familiar to the Massachusetts
privateersmen during the last years of the Revolution. The
“noble captain,” we believe, was an ancestor of the inimitable
author, <span class='sc'>Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>, of Salem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have extended this article already too far, and will
present but one other specimen of our revolutionary lyrics.
It is not known who wrote “American Taxation.” In an
edition printed in 1811, it is credited to <span class='sc'>B. Gleason</span>, and
on an earlier impression we find the name of <span class='sc'>Benjamin
Franklin</span>. We do not, however, believe it was written

<p class='line0'>Kind fortune their director, and Providence their guide;</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>To sail they were commanded about the hour of noon,</p>
<p class='line0'>At Plymouth shore they landed, the twenty-first of June;</p>
<p class='line0'>The savages were nettled, with fear they fled away,</p>
<p class='line0'>And peaceably they settled on North America.</p>

<p class='line0'>Therefore you cannot scare us, in North America.</p>

<p class='noindent'>are forgotten, and other songs and ballads of our Revolution
will in the next century be prized more highly than the
richest gems of Percy or Motherwell. They are the very
mirrors of the times in which they were sung. As may
have been observed, we have given none of the lyrics of
<span class='sc'>Freneau</span>. We shall, perhaps, review the “American Körner”
in a future number. Free, daring, honest, and with
sarcastic powers which made his pen as terrible to the
Tories and the British officers as that of Coleridge was to
Napoleon, he did as good service to the great cause from
his obscure printing office, as many a more celebrated patriot
did in camp or legislature. The energy and exultation
with which he recounted, in rapidly written songs, the successes
of the Whigs, were equaled only by the keenness
of his wit, and the appositeness of his humor. Nor was it
in satire and song alone that he excelled. Though we claim
not for him, superior as he was to his American cotemporaries,
the praise due to a true poet, some of his pieces are
distinguished for a directness of expression, a manliness,
fervor, and fine vein of poetical feeling, that will secure for
them a permanent place in our literature. Yet <span class='sc'>Freneau</span>—the
patriot, poet, soldier—died miserably poor, within the
last ten years, while the national legislature was anxiously
debating what should be done with the “surplus money in
the treasury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>To Readers and Correspondents.</span>—It affords us great
pleasure to be able to state that this work will hereafter be
enriched with papers from the pen of RICHARD H. DANA,
the author of “The Buccaneers,” “The Idle Man,” etc.
It will not, we think, be doubted that, with <span class='sc'>Bryant</span>,
<span class='sc'>Cooper</span>, <span class='sc'>Dana</span>, <span class='sc'>Hoffman</span>, <span class='sc'>Longfellow</span>, etc., we have
now a better corps of contributors than any other magazine
in the English language. Mr. <span class='sc'>Dana</span>’s first article will
grace our pages for November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Night at Haddon Hall,” in this number is from the
pen of a venerable, but enthusiastic antiquary, as its manner
may bear witness. Mrs. <span class='sc'>Anne Radcliffe</span>’s ingenious
“situations” for her heroines were never more “horrible”
than that of Miss Chamberlain in the tapestried chamber,
and the tale of Haddon Hall has the rare merit of being <span class='it'>true</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be observed that our present number contains a
story by Mrs. “<span class='sc'>Mary Clavers</span>,” the clever author of “A
New Home” and “Forest Life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several articles prepared for our present issue are, unavoidably,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
